PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS







Shares

SOLV Energy, Inc.

Class A Common Stock




This is the initial public offering of shares of Class A common stock of SOLV Energy, Inc. (the “Company”). We are offering





shares of our Class A common stock.

Prior to this offering, there has been no
public market for our Class A common stock. It is currently estimated that the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock will be between $




and
$




. We intend to apply to have our Class A common stock listed on




(the
“




”) under the symbol “MWH.”

We will have two classes of common
stock outstanding after this offering: Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Each share of our Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote per share and each share of our Class B common stock entitles its holder
to one vote per share on all matters presented to our stockholders generally. Immediately following the consummation of this offering, all of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock will be held by the Continuing Equity Owners (as
defined herein), which will represent in the aggregate approximately




% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock after this offering (or approximately





% if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares).

As a result, the Continuing Equity Owners will be able to control any action requiring the general approval of our stockholders, including
the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any merger or sale of the Company or substantially all of our assets. See “Management.”

Our post-offering organizational structure, commonly referred to as an umbrella

partnership-C-corporation,
or
UP-C
structure, provides potential future tax benefits to both SOLV Energy, Inc. and our Continuing
Equity Owners. Prior to the completion of this offering, SOLV Energy, Inc. will enter into a Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined herein) with certain Continuing Equity Owners that will provide for certain cash payments to be made by SOLV Energy,
Inc. to such Continuing Equity Owners in respect of certain of the future tax benefits received by SOLV Energy, Inc., utilizing cash for the benefit of such unitholders that otherwise would have been available to us for other uses and for the
benefit of all of our stockholders. The terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement will be described in a subsequent filing. See “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.”

We will be a holding company, and upon consummation of this offering and the application of proceeds therefrom, our principal asset will consist
of LLC Interests (as defined herein) we acquire directly from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC with the proceeds from this offering collectively representing an aggregate




% economic interest in SOLV
Energy Holdings LLC. The remaining




% economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will be owned by the Continuing Equity Owners through their ownership of LLC Interests.

SOLV Energy, Inc. will be the sole managing member of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. We will operate and control all of the business and affairs of
SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and, through SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, conduct our business.

Following this offering, we will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the





rules. See “Our Organizational Structure” and “Management—Controlled Company Exception.”




Investing in our Class A common stock involves risks. See “
Risk Factors
” starting on page 20
to read about factors you should consider before buying shares of our Class A common stock.




Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these
securities or determined if this prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

This summary highlights certain significant aspects of our business and this offering. This is a summary of information contained elsewhere in this
prospectus, is not complete and does not contain all of the information that you should consider before making your investment decision. You should carefully read the entire prospectus, including the information presented under the sections entitled
“Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, before making an investment decision. This summary contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties.

Our Company

We are a leading provider of infrastructure services to the power industry, including engineering, procurement, construction, testing, commissioning,
operations, maintenance and repowering. We have constructed more than 500 power plants representing 20 GW
dc
of generating capacity since we were founded in 2008, and we currently provide
O&M services under long-term agreements to 144 operating power plants representing over 17 GW
dc
of generating capacity. Engineering News Record ranks us    and
in the United States in the solar and power contractor categories, respectively, based on 2024 revenues.

We specialize in
designing, building and maintaining utility-scale solar and battery storage projects with capacities of 200 MW
dc
and larger and related T&D infrastructure. We were the largest builder of
new utility-scale solar energy projects in the United States based on the number of MW
dc
constructed from 2014 to 2023 according to Solar Power World and the second largest provider of O&M
services to existing utility-scale solar energy projects in the Americas based on the number of MW
dc
managed in 2023 according to Wood Mackenzie. As of June 30, 2025,   % of
our total backlog was EPC services for new construction projects and   % was O&M services for existing infrastructure. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Backlog” for a discussion of our backlog.

Demand for new generation capacity and related infrastructure services is growing rapidly
in the United States. The combination of growth in the number and capacity of data centers, manufacturing reshoring, increasing use of HVAC caused by more extreme weather, electrification of industrial processes and retirement of existing coal-fired
generation facilities are resulting in rapid load growth that cannot be met by existing generation capacity. According to Wood Mackenzie, an average of    GW
ac
of new
generation capacity will be constructed annually in the United States from 2025 through 2034 which is     the prior
ten-year
period’s average. Solar and battery storage projects will
account for nearly   % of the capacity added from 2025 through 2034 according to Wood Mackenzie as they are easier to permit, use equipment that is more readily available, deliver a lower levelized cost of energy and are faster to build
than competing forms of power generation such as gas and nuclear. As of June 30, 2025, we had backlog of approximately $




billion.

Our customers include project developers, independent power producers and utilities. Our new construction projects are typically executed over 12 to 18 months
pursuant to one or more LNTP agreements followed by a lump sum EPC contract. Under LNTP agreements, our customers pay us to perform initial engineering and site investigation work, procure long lead time equipment and begin initial mobilization of
our workforce and equipment, the results of which we use to refine our price to construct the project. LNTP agreements significantly reduce our risk because they allow us to identify unforeseen costs and incorporate them into our price
prior

to entering into the EPC contract. Our customers also benefit from LNTP agreements because they reduce the probability that there will be unforeseen change orders or delays during construction. See “Business—Customer Contracts—EPC
Services” for a discussion of our EPC contracting process and typical provisions.

We provide O&M services pursuant to long-term contracts
that typically obligate the customer to pay us a fixed fee for operations and routine preventative maintenance and additional fees for corrective maintenance on a time

and materials basis. Our O&M contracts typically have a minimum term of five years and renew automatically for successive one year periods at the end of the initial term. When a customer
enters into an O&M agreement with us, they typically give us operational control of their power plants which we manage through a NERC-registered medium impact control center located in our San Diego headquarters. Our control center enables us to
provide our customers remote monitoring, diagnostic and dispatch capabilities on a 24/7 basis. Many of our customers that use us to build new power plants also use our O&M services. See “Business—Customer Contracts—O&M
Services” for a discussion of our O&M contracting process and typical provisions.

We are headquartered in San Diego, California and have 14
additional offices located across the United States. We employ approximately 1,600 team members specializing in engineering, project management, electrical systems, safety and compliance, innovation and technology, business development, marketing,
finance, human resources and talent development. Our employees collaborate across diverse scopes of work, resulting in continuous improvement, enhanced communication and greater efficiency that creates value for our customers.

Our Lifecycle Approach

We offer an integrated suite of
services to meet the needs of our customers throughout the entire lifecycle of their projects, from initial design through operation. Our services for new projects include engineering, equipment procurement, construction, testing and commissioning.
We generally refer to these services as “EPC services.” Our services for existing projects include monitoring, preventative maintenance, corrective maintenance, upgrading and repowering. We generally refer to these services as
“O&M services” and the combination of EPC and O&M services as our “lifecycle approach.” We believe we are the only top five EPC that offers O&M services at scale and the only top five O&M services provider that
offers EPC services at scale. We have designed our service offering with the goal of becoming a long-term partner to our customers who creates value for them throughout the life of their projects. We believe our lifecycle approach enables us to:






•




Demonstrate
value-add
to customers by increasing their revenue
potential and reducing their O&M costs, rather than just minimizing initial construction cost.
According to NREL, the average owner of a utility-scale solar plus storage project will generate revenues equal to more than
times its EPC cost and spend more than 1.6x times its EPC cost on operations and maintenance over the project’s lifetime. Because revenues and O&M costs are much greater than EPC costs, relatively small investments in energy generation,
equipment uptime and maintenance expenses can be more valuable to the customer than a lower EPC price. To put that in context, a 2% improvement in energy generation that results in a 2% improvement in revenues over the project’s lifetime is
equivalent to a more than   % reduction in EPC costs and a 2% reduction in O&M costs over the project’s lifetime is equivalent to nearly a   % reduction in EPC costs using NREL’s PV System Cost Model. Under our
lifecycle approach, we work with our customers to design their projects, select equipment and integrate the systems on site to maximize energy generation and minimize unnecessary maintenance. We also seek to provide ongoing O&M services after
the project is operational to ensure it delivers peak performance. Our competitors who only provide construction services do not have the long-term operating data that we have access to through our O&M services so we do not believe they can
offer the same insights into project design, equipment selection and system integration that we can. Our competitors who only provide O&M services are limited in their ability to influence the performance of a project because they do not play a
role in designing the project or selecting the equipment used in it like we do.





•




Bring our customers capabilities that “O&M only” companies cannot.
Through our new
construction business, we have significant resources, including more than 725 craftworkers and technicians, and a fleet of over 850 vehicles and trucks and more than 200 pieces of earthmoving and other heavy equipment. We use these resources to
provide services to our O&M customers that we believe most “O&M only” companies are unable to self-perform, including repairing major damage from weather events such as hailstorms, hurricanes and tornadoes; performing major
equipment upgrades; expanding sites to add incremental generation capacity or battery storage; and repowering.

•




Generate long-term, recurring revenues.
Our lifecycle approach creates recurring revenues through
multi-year O&M agreements and related corrective maintenance work on both the power plant and its transmission infrastructure. We have historically generated annual corrective maintenance revenues equal to 80% to 90% of the amount our customers
pay us in fixed fees for operations and preventative maintenance. Our O&M contracts have a minimum term of five years and typically renew automatically at the end of the term for successive one year terms.





•




Create incumbency that makes it difficult for our competitors to displace us.
Solar energy and battery
storage projects have useful lives of 35 years and 20 years, respectively, according to the EIA, and a power plant’s interconnection can be renewed indefinitely. Our lifecycle approach creates continuous interaction with our customers and their
projects, which gives us knowledge of their facilities and operations that no other service providers have. We have maintained an
on-site
presence at some of our customers projects since we began offering
O&M services. Continuous interaction with our customers and their sites creates incumbency that we believe makes it difficult for our competitors to displace us.





•




Identify new business opportunities our competitors may never see.
We remotely monitor and have a constant

on-site
presence at, or have our service technicians routinely visit, all of the power plants we manage. Our continuous interaction with our customers’ projects allows us to identify maintenance,
expansion and repowering opportunities at their sites that our competitors may never see.





•




Maximize our revenue potential from each project.
According to NREL, the average owner of a utility-scale
solar plus battery storage project will spend $0.84 per watt
dc
on EPC services, $0.07 per watt
dc
on asset management, $0.21 per watt
dc
on preventative maintenance and $1.07 per watt
dc
on corrective maintenance over its 35 year life. We believe our lifecycle approach enables
us to maximize our revenue potential from every project we build by providing services throughout the project’s entire lifecycle.





•




Leverage long-term operating data to improve construction methods, make better equipment selections, improve
uptime and increase energy generation.
Our control center captures approximately 2 million data points per second on every power plant that we manage. We have accumulated more than 50 terabytes of operating data across the power plants we
monitor through Vitals, which we believe represents one of the largest repositories of operating data on solar and battery storage projects in the world. We use the operating data that we have gathered to improve our construction methods and make
better equipment selections as well as gain insights into ways to improve uptime and increase energy generation for our customers.

Our Market Opportunity

New Construction.
Demand
for our EPC services is driven primarily by investment in new generation, generally, and solar and battery storage projects with capacities of 200 MW
dc
and larger in the United States,
specifically. According to NREL, EPC costs represent approximately 41% of the total cost of a new utility-scale solar plus battery storage project. According to the EIA, 82% of the new generation capacity added in the United States in 2024 was solar
and battery storage, and annual investment in new utility-scale solar and battery storage projects with capacities of 200 MW
ac
and larger will grow from $    billion in
2024 to $     billion in 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate of   %, according to Wood Mackenzie. We believe key drivers supporting continued growth in demand for new solar and battery storage
projects include:





•




Accelerating load growth.
Electricity consumption in the United States will grow 17.3% from 2024 to 2034
compared with only 5.2% over the prior
10-year
period from 2014 to 2024 according to the EIA and Wood Mackenzie. Demand for power is growing rapidly as businesses move manufacturing operations back to the
United States, companies make investments in energy-intensive digital infrastructure, more extreme temperatures cause businesses and consumers to require more HVAC and more commercial and industrial processes are electrified.

•




Shorter lead times compared to other forms of generation.
Utility-scale solar energy projects can
typically be constructed in approximately one year or less, which compares to approximately three years and nine years for natural
gas-fired
and nuclear power plants, respectively, according to BNEF. The lead
time required for new natural
gas-fired
generation may also grow in the future as several major gas turbine manufacturers have reported multi-year order backlogs and sold out capacity. The shorter lead times
required to bring new solar energy and battery storage projects online make them an attractive source of new generation capacity in regions with accelerating load growth.





•




Lower cost and less environmental impact than natural
gas-fired

generation.
Solar energy offers the lowest cost of new generation capacity in the United States, according to Wood Mackenzie, and the generation of solar energy does not emit any greenhouse gases. This makes solar energy an attractive source of
new generation capacity to utilities, corporations and the public when compared to new
gas-fired
generation. The falling cost of battery technologies is also making it possible for solar to compete with
natural
gas-fired
as economical base load generation in certain areas of the United States.





•




Retirements of coal-fired generation.
Nearly     GW
ac
of coal-fired and other generating capacity representing   % of the existing generation fleet in the United States as of
year-end
2024 is
slated to be retired from 2025 through 2034 according to the Wood Mackenzie. In most cases, these facilities must be replaced with new power plants to ensure the regions they serve will have adequate power to meet the growing needs of businesses and
consumers.

Existing Infrastructure.
Demand for our O&M services is driven primarily by the number and capacity of operating
utility-scale solar energy and battery storage projects and their age. Older projects typically require more maintenance, including inverter replacements and battery augmentation. According to NREL, the average owner of a utility-scale solar plus
battery storage project will spend approximately 1.6x times the project’s original EPC cost on O&M over its lifetime. Spending on O&M for solar energy and battery storage projects will grow from $     billion in
2025 to $    billion in 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate of   % according to Wood Mackenzie. We believe key drivers supporting continued growth in demand for our O&M services include:





•




Rapidly growing installed base.
According to Wood Mackenzie, the capacity of operating utility-scale solar
energy and battery storage projects in the United States will increase from     GW
dc
and     GW
ac
at
the end of 2024 to nearly     GW
dc
and     GW
ac
, at the end of 2034, respectively, representing
compound annual growth rates of   % and   %, respectively. As the total capacity of solar energy and battery storage projects increase so will spending on O&M services.





•




Aging fleet that will require increasing levels of maintenance.
According to Wood Mackenzie,
GW
ac
and     GW
ac
of solar energy and battery storage projects will be more than ten years old by
the end of 2030 and 2034, respectively, compared to only     GW
ac
and     GW
ac
, respectively, at the
end of 2024. Most solar energy and battery storage projects require major maintenance following their tenth year of operation, including inverter replacements and battery augmentation. As the installed base of solar and battery storage projects ages
so will spending on corrective maintenance to address equipment failures.





•




Increasing return on investment from repowering.
Owners of existing solar energy projects can increase
their revenues by adding battery storage, replacing existing solar modules with newer models that generate more power and upgrading inverters to high efficiency models. We believe that rising power prices, falling battery prices and increasing
equipment performance make repowering more attractive as projects age. From 2020 to 2024, the average wholesale power price in the United States increased 45%, while the average price per kWh for
lithium-ion

stationary batteries decreased nearly 30% and the average efficiency of a solar module increased 14% according to the EIA and BNEF.

Our Strengths

We believe the following strengths position us to capitalize on continued growth in demand for the services we provide, reinforce our leadership position in
the markets we focus on, and differentiate us from our competitors:





•




Long history, large scale and market leadership.
We have been building, operating and maintaining solar
energy projects continuously for over 15 years. We have constructed more than 500 power plants across 35 states. We are one of a small number of companies that has completed solar energy projects 200 MW
dc

or larger. We were the largest builder of solar energy projects in the United States from 2014 to 2023 according to Solar Power World and
the second largest independent provider of O&M services to solar energy projects in the Americas in 2023 according to Wood Mackenzie. We believe our long history, large scale and market leadership give us several advantages over our smaller
competitors with less operating history, including:





•




giving prospective customers confidence that we have the financial and operational resources to complete large,
complex projects;





•




being recognized by our customers’ lenders as a “bankable” service provider that reduces execution
and operational risk, which we believe translates to better financing terms for our customers;





•




giving us the experience and operating data to accurately price risk;





•




obtaining preferential terms from equipment suppliers;





•




making it easier to attract and retain talented employees;





•




benefiting from proprietary means and methods developed over millions of hours of experience building and
maintaining projects;





•




giving us the financial strength to make investments in construction equipment such as pile drivers, boring
machines, deep foundation drills, trenchers and customized solar production equipment that give us operational advantages; and





•




reducing the risk that any single project or conditions in a particular region of the country pose to our
financial performance.





•




Lifecycle approach that differentiates us from our competitors, creates recurring revenues and maximizes our
revenue potential from each project.
We believe we are the only top five EPC that also offers O&M services at scale and the only top five O&M services provider that also offers EPC services at scale. We believe providing both EPC and
O&M services differentiates us from our competitors that only provide EPC services because customers see us as a long-term partner that can add value to their operations throughout the entire lifecycle of their projects rather than a contractor
for a particular job. Providing both EPC and O&M services also allows us to create recurring revenues and maximize our revenue potential from every project we build because we can generate revenue from our customers every year over the entire
life of their projects.





•




Industry-Leading O&M Capabilities.
We have developed a comprehensive set of O&M capabilities that
enable us to serve the needs of owners after their power plants commence operations, including a NERC-registered medium impact operations center that provides 24/7 monitoring and control for power plants, a team of over 174 field service technicians
that are authorized to perform warranty work on most major brands of equipment used by our customers and a proprietary software platform called Vitals that integrates with our customers’ SCADA systems to provide real-time system performance
information.





•




Contracting process that minimizes construction risk through LNTP agreements.
We typically engage with
customers on new construction projects by entering into an initial LNTP agreement pursuant to which the customer pays us for engineering and site investigation work, including in depth soil and foundation pile testing. The initial LNTP agreement
allows us to thoroughly evaluate site conditions and incorporate them into



5

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.







our price for the project. Following the initial LNTP agreement, we typically enter into additional LNTP agreements for procurement of long-lead time equipment and initial site mobilization
before we enter into a lump sum EPC contract with our customer. All of the services we provide pursuant to LNTP agreements are prepaid by the customer through deposits that are due on signing of the agreement. LNTP agreements significantly reduce
our risk because they allow us to identify unforeseen costs and incorporate them into our price
prior
to entering into the EPC contract. Our customers also benefit from LNTP agreements because they reduce the probability that there will be
unforeseen change orders or delays during construction.





•




Direct beneficiary of accelerating load growth and the retirement of fossil generation.
The consumption of
power in the United States is forecast to grow 17.3% from 2024 through 2034 which compares with only 5.2% over the prior
10-year
period from 2014 to 2024 according to the EIA and Wood Mackenzie. At the same
time, more than   % of the existing generation fleet in the United States is slated to be retired from 2025 through 2034 according to Wood Mackenzie. The combination of growing demand for power coupled with the large number of fossil
generation retirements has created increasing demand for new generation capacity. According to Wood Mackenzie, the average amount of new generation capacity constructed annually in the U.S. from 2025 to 2034 will grow
to    GW
ac
per year compared to the prior
10-year
period. Nearly   % of the new generation capacity built from 2025 to 2034
will be solar and battery storage projects according to Wood Mackenzie. We believe increasing demand for power, fossil generation retirements and the large proportion of new generation that is expected to be solar and battery storage projects will
result in growing demand for our services.





•




Longstanding relationships with leading independent power producers, utilities and developers.
We strive
to build long-term relationships with large customers that make significant investments in new power plants every year. We generated all of our 2024 revenues from jobs for clients that were also clients during the past three years and the average
length of our relationship with our top 10 clients in 2024 was four years. Additionally, we have dedicated teams of technicians that are
co-located
at many of our clients’ facilities to assist with the
operation and maintenance of their power plants, further embedding us with our customers.





•




Economies of scale in O&M services.
Most preventative maintenance of solar and battery storage
projects is undertaken by technical service teams that travel from
site-to-site
on a route. The denser their route, measured by the number of projects in close proximity
to one another, the more revenue the service team will generate for each hour they work. We provide preventative maintenance services to 144 power plants which has allowed us to create optimized routes that maximize the revenue we generate from each
hour worked by our service employees.





•




Comprehensive risk management.
We have developed a comprehensive risk management system that is designed
to ensure our projects achieve their target margins. To ensure we accurately estimate project costs, we employ cross-functional teams that collaborate on each project to develop project-specific pricing and execution strategies. We validate our
pricing and
de-risk
our target margins by entering into one or more LNTP agreements with our customers. We seek to further manage our risk by including standard provisions in all our EPC contracts that limit
our risk, conducting rigorous reviews of all agreements and requiring senior management approval before contracts are signed. We monitor our performance against our targets through daily, weekly and monthly reviews of all projects by our senior
management team. We also routinely conduct independent reviews of operational projects for quality and safety.





•




Strong free cash flow generation.
We prioritize free cash flow generation. Elements of our business model
that allow us to generate strong free cash flow include our contract structure which requires our customers to make upfront deposits prior to us beginning work and incurring costs; payment terms that obligate our customers to make monthly progress
payments; modest capital expenditures as a percentage of our revenues; and a low level of debt which keeps our cash interest cost low. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated $117.6 million of net cash provided by operating
activities which was equivalent to 72.0% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the period.

•




Culture of innovation that prioritizes tech-enablement.
We believe that integrating technology with
business processes enhances efficiency, quality, predictability and customer experience. Over the past decade, we have developed several market-leading technology solutions, including Sunscreen, a proprietary software solution we developed to manage
solar energy projects, and Vitals, our proprietary O&M analytics platform. Sunscreen allows project teams to track construction progress online, offering clients near real-time status updates. Vitals detects and diagnoses asset-level issues in
real-time, enabling customers to act quickly and maximize uptime. We believe we have also been at the forefront in process automation and optimization through our internally developed data analytics platform; use of robotics in the field; aerial
drones; and
AI-based
image processing.





•




Experienced management team with long tenures in the construction and power industries
. Our management
team has an average of more than 25 years of experience, including in high performing EPC and O&M services and power generation businesses. They are experts at managing large and diverse work forces to deliver generation projects
on-time
and
on-budget
while operating safely. We have a team-oriented culture and encourage candor from our employees, which we believe helps us to succeed and drive
operational excellence. We believe that operating with purpose, passion and creativity benefits our clients, stakeholders and employees as well as the communities where we operate.

Our Growth Strategy

We have developed a series of
interrelated strategies designed to maximize our growth potential, including:





•




Continuing to expand market share.
As solar energy projects grow larger and more complex, we believe large
EPCs, such as ourselves, are well-positioned to increase our share of the market. From 2014 to 2024, the average size of a planned solar energy project increased more than 5x from 20 MW
ac
to
112 MW
ac
according to the EIA. At the same time, there are fewer and fewer sites available that are flat, with soils that do not require drilling or specialized foundations, and close to a
substation with the capacity to interconnect new resources without upgrades. The greater financial requirements that come with larger projects coupled with increased scope of work required for more challenging sites is making it increasingly
difficult for smaller contractors to compete. Our average annual market share has increased from 10% in the 2012 to 2017 period to 14% in the 2018 to 2023 period according to data from Solar Power World. We believe the ratio of our next 12 months
backlog to our last 12 months reported revenues underscores our continuing market share growth.





•




Growing our revenues from existing infrastructure.
O&M services, including preventative and corrective
maintenance, equipment upgrades, storm damage work and repowering generate recurring and
re-occurring
revenues over the life of a project that typically carry higher margins than new construction. Our strategy
is to increase the share of our revenue that comes from O&M services by increasing the number of O&M customers that we have. We believe that by focusing on existing infrastructure in addition to new construction, we will be able to grow our
revenues faster than our competitors who focus only on new construction as well as reduce the impact of adverse changes in the amount or pace of new construction in any year on our financial results.





•




Expanding into new
end-markets.
We intend to apply our
know-how
and capabilities to new
end-markets
that are experiencing significant growth. We are currently evaluating the utility infrastructure and data center markets which we
believe may offer both attractive EPC and O&M opportunities. For example, on June 13, 2025, we acquired Spartan Infrastructure, Inc. (“Spartan Infrastructure”), a provider of T&D infrastructure services. Spartan Infrastructure
expanded our capability to perform high voltage work on substations and other utility infrastructure. With these expanded capabilities, we believe we will be able to generate additional revenues from T&D work related to solar and battery storage
projects as well as compete for utility projects related to the expansion, upgrading or replacement of grid infrastructure.

•




Leveraging innovation to improve efficiency and increase margins.
We plan to apply data analytics,
automation and robotics to streamline processes, reduce labor hours, optimize resource allocation and improve quality. For example, we recently made an investment into a company that is developing robots to perform certain maintenance functions that
currently require large teams of laborers. We also have a dedicated team focused on developing and piloting new methods, tools and equipment that reduce labor hours with the goal of increasing our margins and shortening construction timelines.






•




Continuing to invest in craft skilled labor.
We are a people business that depends on attracting and
retaining high quality employees to continue our growth. To ensure we can attract and develop the best employees, we are working with trade unions to develop apprenticeship programs for craftsman and technicians and with universities to create
internships for engineering students. In 2024, more than 300 apprentices and students gained
on-the-job
training experience and exposure to our company through our
apprenticeship and internship programs. These programs allow us to identify future talent early as well as expose prospective employees to what makes our company and culture attractive in a more comprehensive way than is possible through a
traditional recruiting process.





•




Making targeted acquisitions.
We believe that acquisitions can accelerate our growth by adding
capabilities that we do not currently have, creating access to new customers and expanding our geographic footprint. Our strategy is to acquire firms that offer complementary services to our own, operate in attractive markets where we do not
currently have a presence and have a track record of strong financial performance and safe operations.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA



We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP. To supplement this information, we also use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA,

non-GAAP
financial measures, in this prospectus. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for
(i) non-cash
compensation expense; (ii) the (gain) or loss on the disposal of assets and the extinguishment of debt; (iii) the change in fair value of derivatives; (iv) asset impairment charges;
(v) non-recurring
private equity management fees; and (vi) certain other items which we do not consider indicative of future operating performance such as
one-time

legal settlements not considered part of normal course business operations, transaction, integration, severance, transition and other non-cash costs. We adjust for these items in our Adjusted EBITDA as our management believes these items would
distort from their ability to efficiently view and assess core operating trends. Our board of directors, management, and investors use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because such measures allow them to compare our
operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and items outside the control of our
management team (such as income taxes).

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under GAAP. Our use of the terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are intended as supplemental measures of our
performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income (loss), earnings per share, net sales, net income margin or any
other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have
important limitations as analytical tools, and such measures should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include:





•




EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;





•




EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;






•




Although depreciation and amortization are
non-cash
charges, the assets
being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and





•




Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness
as comparative measures.

In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar
to those eliminated in this prospectus.

RISK FACTORS

Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors, as well as
other information contained in this prospectus, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in
our Class A common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, in which case the trading price of our Class A common stock could
decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some statements in this prospectus, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. See the section of this prospectus captioned “Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Risks Related to Operating Our Business

A wide range of factors, many that are beyond our control, can impact the timing, performance or profitability of our projects, any of which can result
in additional costs to us, reductions or delays in revenues, the payment of liquidated damages by us or project termination.

Our business is
dependent on successfully constructing projects for our customers. Many of our projects involve challenging design, engineering, financing, permitting, interconnection, right of way acquisition, procurement, construction, operation and maintenance
phases that occur over extended time periods, including sometimes over several years, and we have encountered and may in the future encounter project delays, additional costs or project performance issues as a result of, among other things:





•




inability to meet project schedule requirements, achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards for a
project or failure to comply with mandatory reliability standards set forth by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), which can result in increased costs, through rework, replacement or otherwise, monetary penalties
to NERC or the payment of liquidated damages to the customer or contract termination;





•




failure to accurately estimate project costs or accurately establish the scope of our services;






•




failure to make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards (e.g., engineering standards);






•




unforeseen circumstances or project modifications not included in our cost estimates or covered by our contract
for which we cannot obtain adequate compensation, including concealed or unknown environmental, geological or geographical site conditions or technical problems such as design or engineering issues;





•




changes in laws or permitting, interconnection and regulatory requirements during the course of our work;






•




delays in the delivery or management of design or engineering information, equipment or materials;






•




our or a customer’s failure to manage a project, including the inability to timely obtain land, permits or
rights of way or meet other permitting, interconnection, regulatory or environmental requirements or conditions;





•




changes to project or customer schedules;





•




natural disasters or emergencies, including wildfires and earthquakes, as well as significant weather events
(e.g., hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, hail storms, droughts, blizzards and extreme temperatures) and adverse or unseasonable weather conditions (e.g., prolonged rainfall or snowfall or early thaw in the northern U.S.);






•




difficult terrain and site conditions where delivery of materials and availability of labor are impacted or where
there is exposure to harsh and hazardous conditions;



20





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.





•




protests and other public activism, legal challenges or other political activity or opposition to a project;






•




other factors such as terrorism, geopolitical conflicts, public health crises (e.g., pandemics or epidemics) and
delays attributable to U.S. government shutdowns or any related under-staffing of government departments or agencies;





•




changes in the cost, availability, lead times or quality of equipment, commodities, materials, consumables or
labor; and





•




delay or failure to perform by suppliers, subcontractors or other third parties, or our failure to coordinate
performance of such parties.

Many of these difficulties and delays are beyond our control and can negatively impact our ability to
complete the project in accordance with the required delivery schedule, performance requirements or achieve our anticipated operating income margin on the project. Delays and additional costs associated with delays may be substantial and not
recoverable from third parties, and in some cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays, including in circumstances where we have guaranteed project completion or performance by a scheduled date and incur liquidated damages
if we do not meet such schedule.

We generate a significant portion of our revenues from lump sum contracts, pursuant to which our customer pays us a
fixed amount regardless of the costs that we incur. The contracts for these projects often involve complex pricing, scope of services and other bid preparation components that require challenging estimates and assumptions on the part of our
personnel far in advance of contract performance, which increases the risk that costs incurred on such projects can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original estimates.

Additionally, in certain of our EPC contracts we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date and sometimes provided the project, when
completed, will also achieve certain performance standards. If we fail to complete these projects on time or the equipment we design, furnish and/or install does not meet guaranteed performance standards, we may be liable to our customers for
damages, which can be significant. Our O&M services contracts also require us to meet certain minimum performance standards. If we fail to meet agreed project deadlines and/or meet guaranteed performance standards under our EPC contracts, or we
fail to perform as required under our O&M service contracts, we may be held responsible for costs incurred by the customer resulting from any delay or any modifications made in order to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of
contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or obligations to
re-perform
substandard work. If we are required to pay such costs, the total costs of the project would likely exceed our original estimate, and
we could experience reduced profits or a loss related to the applicable project or contract. In addition, such failures on our part could result in project delays, project cancelations, service contract cancelations or damage to our relationships
with customers, as well as damage to our reputation, which can be exacerbated when difficulties arise on a high-profile project. As a result, additional costs or penalties, a reduction in our productivity or efficiency or a project termination in
any given period could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to secure new contracts.

Our results of operations, financial condition and other financial and operational disclosures are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ
from actual results or future outcomes.

In preparing our consolidated financial statements and financial and operational disclosures, estimates
and assumptions are used by management to report, among other things, assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are necessary because certain information utilized is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated
with a high degree of precision from available data or cannot be readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. In some cases, these estimates are particularly difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment, and as
a result actual results and future outcomes can differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, our remaining
performance obligations and



21





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



backlog are difficult to determine with certainty. Customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release work to us, and many contracts may be terminated on short notice.
Cancelation or reduction in scope of a contract can significantly reduce the revenues and profit we recognize. Consequently, our estimates of remaining performance obligations and backlog may not be accurate, and we may not be able to realize our
estimated remaining performance obligations and backlog.

Impairments to goodwill, other intangible assets, and long-lived assets, the values of which are
dependent upon certain estimates and assumptions, could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We record goodwill when we acquire a business, which must be tested at least annually for impairment. Any future impairments
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized.

Changes in estimates
related to revenues and costs associated with our contracts with customers could result in a reduction or elimination of revenues, a reduction of profits or the recognition of losses.

For lump sum contracts, we recognize revenue as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, and earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts
are based on estimates of contract revenues, costs and profitability as discussed in Note 5 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in contract estimates are recognized on a cumulative

catch-up
basis in the period in which the revisions to the estimates are made, and contract losses are recognized in full in the period in which they become evident. Variable consideration amounts, including,
among other things, unexecuted change orders and liquidated damages penalties, may also cause changes in contract estimates. In addition, we recognize amounts associated with change orders and/or claims as revenue when it is probable that a
significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Actual amounts collected in connection with change orders and claims have in the past
and may in the future differ from estimated amounts. Consequently, the timing for recognition of revenues and profit or loss and any subsequent changes in estimates is uncertain and could result in a reduction or an elimination of previously
reported revenues or profits or the recognition of losses on the associated contract. Any such adjustments could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.



Backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits and may not accurately represent future
revenue.

Backlog is difficult to determine accurately and is not a comprehensive indicator of future revenue amounts or timing, and companies
within our industry may define backlog differently. Reductions in backlog due to project or contract cancelation, termination or scope adjustment by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually
receive from contracts in backlog. In the event of a project cancelation, termination or scope adjustment, we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog. The timing of contract awards, duration of large new
contracts and the mix of services, subcontracted work and material in our contracts can significantly affect backlog. Given these factors and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the
revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of a fiscal year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following fiscal year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone
indicator. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance that our estimates of backlog will accurately reflect future revenue. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion on
how we calculate backlog for our business.

The imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures
implemented by the U.S. and other governments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Recently there have been significant changes to U.S. trade policies, sanctions, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including, but not limited to, trade
policies and tariffs affecting products from outside of the U.S. For example, in



22





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



early 2025, the U.S. presidential administration announced significant new tariffs on foreign imports into the U.S., including from China, Mexico, Canada and certain Southeast Asian countries,
and has proposed additional new tariffs that may be implemented in the future. The extent and duration of increased tariffs and the resulting impact on general economic conditions and on our business are uncertain and depend on various factors, such
as negotiations between the U.S. and affected countries, the responses of other countries or regions, exemptions or exclusions that may be granted, and the availability and cost of alternative sources of supplies. Any new or additional tariffs on
goods imported to the U.S. from China, Mexico, Canada, Southeast Asian or other countries, or products imported into the European Union or other
non-U.S.
markets, could also increase the cost of some of our
services and reduce our margins. In response to the tariffs, we may seek to increase prices to our customers, which may diminish demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Other countries where we or our suppliers, subcontractors or manufacturers source materials and goods used in connection with our business have changed, and may continue to change, their own policies on trade as well as business and
foreign investment in their respective countries. Additionally, it is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about such changes could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these dynamics, we
cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.’s or other countries’ trading relationships or the impact of new laws or regulations adopted by the U.S. or other countries.



Our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.

Our business is subject to seasonality and other factors that can result in significantly different results of operations from quarter to quarter, and
therefore our results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of future results. Our quarterly results have been and may in the future be materially and adversely affected by, among other things:





•




the timing and volume of work we perform and our performance with respect to ongoing projects and services,
including, for example, as a result of changes in customer priorities and the availability of tax credits, delays and reductions in scope of projects, project and agreement terminations, expirations or cancelations, and availability of critical
equipment and supplies;





•




increases in project costs that result from, among other things, natural disasters and emergencies, adverse
weather conditions or events, legal challenges, permitting, interconnection delays, regulatory or environmental processes, tariffs, delays or damage of material, labor productivity and availability, or inaccurate project cost estimates;






•




variations in the size, scope, costs and operating income margins of ongoing projects, as well as the mix of our
customers, contracts and business;





•




fluctuations in economic, political, financial, industry and market conditions on a regional, national or global
basis, including as a result of, among other things, inflationary pressure that impacts our costs associated with labor, equipment and materials; increased interest rates; default or threat of default by the U.S. federal government with respect to
its debt obligations; U.S. government shutdowns; natural disasters and other emergencies (e.g., wildfires, weather-related events or pandemics); deterioration of global or specific trade relationships; or geopolitical conflicts and political unrest;






•




changes in regulation or government policy that causes our customers to delay, change or abandon their projects;






•




pricing pressures as a result of competition;





•




changes in the budgetary spending patterns or strategic plans of customers or governmental entities;






•




supply chain and other logistical difficulties, as well as sourcing restrictions on materials necessary for the
services we provide;





•




liabilities and costs incurred in our operations that are not covered by, or that are in excess of, our
third-party insurance or indemnification rights, including significant liabilities that can arise from



23

hazards at our customers’ sites (e.g., explosions or fires), and which could be exacerbated by the geographies in which we operate;





•




disputes with customers or delays and payment risk relating to billing and payment under our contracts and change
orders, including as a result of customers that encounter financial difficulties, are insolvent or have filed for bankruptcy protection;





•




the resolution of, or unexpected or increased costs associated with, pending or threatened legal proceedings,
indemnity obligations, multiemployer pension plan obligations (e.g., withdrawal liability) or other claims;





•




restructuring, severance and other costs associated with, among other things, winding down certain operations and
exiting markets;





•




estimates and assumptions in determining our financial results, remaining performance obligations and backlog,
including the timing and significance of impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity or other investments, and receivables;





•




the recognition of tax impacts related to changes in tax laws or uncertain tax positions;





•




the timing and magnitude of costs we incur to support our operations or growth internally or through
acquisitions;





•




engineering quality or installation errors, resulting in rework and serial defect liabilities; and






•




accidents and injuries resulting in delays, increased costs, reputational damage and loss of future work.


Any of the above-listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


The reduction, elimination or expiration of government incentives for, or regulations mandating the use of, renewable

energy
and battery storage specifically could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Federal and certain state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners,
end-users
and manufacturers
designed to promote the use of renewable energy and battery storage primarily in the form of tax credits. Consequently, the attractiveness of solar energy and battery storage projects depends in part on the availability of certain government
incentives. We derive our revenues primarily from providing EPC and O&M services to solar energy and battery storage projects. The reduction, elimination or expiration of these incentives, including tax credits for solar and battery storage
projects or renewable portfolio standards may negatively affect the competitiveness of solar electricity relative to conventional and
non-solar
renewable sources of electricity which could reduce the number of
new solar and battery storage projects and, consequently, reduce demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, under currently proposed legislation,
certain investment tax credits and productions tax credits may no longer be available for projects that do not start construction within a certain specified period of time after the legislations’ passage, and/or achieve placement in service by
a specified date.

Limitations on the availability or an increase in the price of materials, equipment and subcontractors that we and our
customers depend on to complete and maintain projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on suppliers and equipment manufacturers to obtain necessary materials and equipment and subcontractors to perform portions of our services, and our
customers rely on suppliers for materials necessary for the construction, maintenance, repair and upgrading of their projects. Limitations on the availability of suppliers, subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our or our
customers’ operations, particularly in the event we or our customers rely on a single or small number of providers. We are also exposed to price increases for materials that are utilized in connection with our operations, including, among other
things, copper, steel, aluminum and equipment (e.g., transformers, inverters and trackers). Prices and availability of



24

materials, suppliers and manufacturers could be materially impacted by, among other things, supply chain and other logistical challenges (including the inability of manufacturers to timely meet
demand), global trade relationships (e.g., tariffs, duties, taxes, assessments or sourcing restrictions) and other general market and geopolitical conditions (e.g., inflation, market volatility, increased interest rates and geopolitical conflicts).
For example, the availability of power transformers utilized in electric power plants has been negatively impacted by the inability of manufacturers to meet current market demand, which has increased and is expected to continue to increase. If the
supply of power transformers and other critical equipment is unable to meet the demand for such equipment, prices and lead times may continue to increase which could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability. In
addition, customers in certain U.S. states, in order to receive certain funding or for other reasons, may expect or compel us to engage a specified percentage of services from suppliers or subcontractors that meet local or diversity-ownership
requirements, which can further limit our pool of available suppliers and subcontractors and limit our ability to secure contracts, maintain our services or grow in those areas. Such laws, regulations and policies relating to diversity programs are
rapidly evolving, and we may face changing or conflicting regulations or requirements related to such matters.

Additionally, successful completion of our
contracts can depend on whether our subcontractors successfully fulfill their contractual obligations. If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations (including making payments to their subcontractors and suppliers), fail to
meet the expected completion dates or quality or safety standards or fail to comply with applicable laws, such shortcomings may subject us to claims or require us to incur additional costs or provide additional services to mitigate such
shortcomings. Regulatory or contractual requirements that require us to outsource a percentage of services to subcontractors also limit our ability to self-perform our services, thereby potentially increasing performance risk associated with our
services. Furthermore, services subcontracted to other service providers generally yield lower margins, and therefore these regulatory requirements can impact our profitability and results of operations.

There are also increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies diligence and monitor the environmental and social performance of their value
chain, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our
suppliers, or potentially design supply chains to avoid certain regions altogether, and, in addition, there may also be retaliation against companies that are perceived as boycotting products manufactured our sourced in certain regions, such as
Xinjiang, China. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, contractual penalties, reputational damage, denial of import for materials for our projects, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees or we may
incur significant costs in the event we are unable to efficiently manage our workforce or the cost of labor increases.

Our ability to perform our
services and grow our business requires hiring, training and retaining the necessary skilled personnel, which is subject to a number of risks. The demand for labor in our industry has continued to increase in response to growing demand for
infrastructure services in the United States. The pool of skilled workers available in our industry has also declined, and may further decline, due primarily to an aging workforce and fewer new workers entering into the trades and professions that
are required for our business, especially with respect to experienced program managers and qualified engineers, electricians and craft workers. The seasonal nature of our industry can also create shortages of qualified labor during periods of high
demand, and the amount of travel required for project management-level positions can impact the number of qualified potential candidates that decide to enter our industry. A shortage in the supply of personnel creates competitive hiring markets that
may result in increased labor expenses, and we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant recruiting and training expenses in order to recruit and train employees. The uncertainty of contract award timing and project delays can also
present difficulties in managing our workforce size. Additionally, we may not be able to attract and retain the necessary skilled personnel for our expanding service offerings. Our inability to



25

efficiently manage our workforce may require us to incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancies that could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Also, we may trigger indemnification obligations to our customers if, on projects where we have agreed to comply with certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards or domestic content standards,
we fail to do so and this causes our customers to lose bonus federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Additionally, the recent inflationary pressure in the U.S. and our other markets has increased our labor costs. Under certain of our contracts, labor costs
are passed through to customers, and the portion of our workforce that is represented by labor unions typically operates under multi-year collective bargaining agreements that provide some visibility into future labor costs prior to the expiration
and renegotiation of such contracts. However, the costs related to a significant amount of our workforce are subject to market conditions, and therefore inflationary pressure could increase our labor costs with respect to those employees. Increased
labor costs can also impact our customers’ decision-making with respect to viability or timing of certain projects, which could result in project delays or cancelations and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

The loss of, or reduction in business from, certain significant customers could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A few customers have in the past and may in the future account for a significant
portion of our revenues. For example, our 10 largest customers accounted for over 90% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. Although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant customers, a
significant customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue business with us at any time or merge or be acquired by a company that decides to reduce or discontinue business with us. A significant customer may also encounter financial constraints,
based on cost of capital or other reasons, file for bankruptcy protection or cease operations, any of which could also result in reduced or discontinued business with us. The loss of business from a significant customer could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Many of our contracts may be canceled or suspended on short notice or may
not be renewed upon completion or expiration, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our customers have in the past and may in the future cancel, suspend, delay or reduce the number or size of projects available to us for a variety of reasons,
including capital constraints, changing market conditions or an inability to meet regulatory requirements. Furthermore, many of our customers may cancel or suspend our contracts for convenience on short notice even if we are not in default under the
contract. Additionally, the
in-house
service organizations of our existing or prospective customers are capable of performing, or acquiring businesses that perform, the same types of services we provide, and
these customers may also face pressure or be compelled by regulatory or other requirements to self-perform an increasing amount of the services we currently perform for them, thereby reducing the services they outsource to us in the future. While
our customers are obligated to compensate us for work completed prior to the cancelation of any contract, if our customers cancel or suspend contracts having significant value or we fail to renew or replace a significant number of our existing
contracts when they expire or are completed, the actual revenue received on such projects prior to such cancelation, suspension, completion or expiration, if any, may be significantly less than the revenue reflected in our backlog estimates. As a
result, we may fail to realize all amounts in our backlog, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may fail to adequately recover on contract modifications against project owners for payment or
performance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have in the past
brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers. We periodically present contract modifications to our customers for changes in contract specifications or requirements, as a result of added scope under such contracts, or for
events outside our control which have impacted the cost or time to perform our obligations under the contracts. We consider unapproved change orders to be contract modifications for which customers have not yet agreed to both scope and price. We
consider claims to be contract modifications which have been denied by our customers, and for which we seek, or will seek, to collect from such customers. These types of claims occur due to, among other things, impacts to projects as a result of
factors not within our control, such as natural disasters, unforeseen site conditions, significant weather events and public health events (e.g., pandemics), delays caused by customers and third parties and changes in project scope, which can result
in delays and/or additional costs that may not be recovered until the claim is resolved. While we generally negotiate with the customer for additional compensation, we may be unable to obtain, through negotiation, arbitration, litigation or
otherwise, adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred. Litigation, arbitration or government approval (if needed) with respect to these matters is generally lengthy and costly, involves significant uncertainty as
to timing and amount of any resolution, and can adversely affect our relationships with existing or potential customers. Furthermore, we could be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of a claim is
pending. Failure to obtain adequate and prompt compensation for these matters can result in a reduction of revenues and gross profit recognized in prior periods or the recognition of a loss. Any such reduction or loss can be substantial and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The nature of our business exposes us to potential
liability for warranty, engineering and other related claims.

We typically provide contractual warranties for our services and materials,
guaranteeing the work performed against, among other things, defects in workmanship, and we may agree to indemnify our customers for losses related to our services. The lengths of these warranty periods varies and can extend for several years.
Certain projects can have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that are broader than the warranties we generally provide. Warranties generally require us to
re-perform
the
services and/or repair or replace the warranted item and any other facilities impacted thereby, at our sole expense, and we could also be responsible for other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. In addition,
we can be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we provide. While we generally require materials and equipment suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we
provide customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials.

Furthermore, our business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of solar power
and renewable generation projects. Because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages.
A significantly adverse or catastrophic event at a project site or completed power plant resulting from the services we performed could result in significant professional or product liability, personal injury (including claims for loss of life) or
property damage claims or other claims against us, as well as reputational harm. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or impact our ability to obtain third-party insurance in the future, and customers, subcontractors or suppliers who
have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. As a result, warranty, engineering and other related claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

During the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to lawsuits, claims and other legal
proceedings, as well as bonding claims and related reimbursement requirements.

We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a
defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers’
compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, compensation for breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence or property damage, environmental
liabilities, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief, as well as interest and attorneys’ fees associated with such
claims. Furthermore, given our recent growth, we have become a more attractive target for lawsuits by various third parties.

We also generally indemnify
our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts, and, in some instances, we are allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers, subcontractors or other third parties.
Because our services in certain instances can be integral to the operation and performance of our customers’ infrastructure, we have been and may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on or damages
caused by accidents and events related to such systems, even if our services are not the cause of such failures and damages. We could also be subject to civil and criminal liabilities, which could be material. Insurance coverage may not be available
or may be insufficient for these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings. The outcome of any allegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings, as well as any public reaction thereto, is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs,
damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management’s attention from our business. Payments of significant amounts, even if reserved, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In addition, certain customers, particularly in connection with new construction, may require us to post performance and payment bonds. These
bonds provide a guarantee that we will perform under the terms of a contract and pay our subcontractors and vendors. If we fail to perform, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond, and we must
reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. To the extent reimbursements are required, the amounts could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We can incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to health and safety matters.

Our operations are inherently hazardous and subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace. While we
have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability
exposure. Although we have taken precautions designed to mitigate this risk, we have suffered serious accidents in connection with our operations, and we anticipate that our operations may result in additional serious accidents in the future. As a
result of these events, we could be subject to substantial penalties, revocation of operating licenses, criminal prosecution or civil litigation, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, that could result in substantial costs and
liabilities. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, our customers could cancel our contracts and elect to
procure future services from other providers. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the costs of projects for our customers, and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Disruptions to our information technology systems or our failure to adequately protect critical data,
sensitive information and technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on information technology systems to manage our operations and other business processes and to protect sensitive company information. We also collect
and retain information about our customers, stockholders, vendors, employees, contractors, business partners and other parties, all of whom expect that we will adequately protect such information. We face numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks
that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems and confidential information as well as the systems and information of key third parties and information technology vendors upon whom we rely,
including from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), malfeasance by
insiders, human or technological error, and as a result of bugs, misconfigurations or exploited vulnerabilities in software or hardware, including malicious code embedded in open-source software, or misconfigurations, “bugs” or other
vulnerabilities in commercial software that is integrated into our or our key third parties and information technology vendors upon whom we rely. Additionally, any integration of artificial intelligence in our or our information technology
vendors’ operations, products or services is expected to pose new or unknown cybersecurity risks and challenges. Furthermore, the energy infrastructure systems on which we work are strategic targets that are at greater risk of cyber-attacks or
acts of terrorism than other targets. Our operations are decentralized with operating companies maintaining some of their own information systems, data and service providers. While our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including
policies, controls and procedures, are designed to cover our operating companies, there can be no assurance that these will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting all information systems and operations. In addition, as a
NERC-registered entity, we are subject to periodic audits by an independent auditor of our compliance with operations and critical infrastructure protection standards. Although we maintain a robust 693 and NERC CIP compliance program pursuant to
NERC requirements, if we fail to comply with NERC CIP standards we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties and increased compliance obligations, any one of which material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. While we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our customers’ confidential or proprietary company information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all threats
to our systems and information. Moreover, we have acquired and continue to acquire companies which may have cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or unsophisticated security measures, which may expose us to significant cybersecurity, operational, and
financial risks until such companies are fully integrated into our information systems and an intrusion into the information systems of a business we acquire may also ultimately compromise our systems. Additionally, while we maintain appropriate
policies and procedures to minimize the cybersecurity risks associated with the use of remote working arrangements by employees, vendors, and other third parties, such arrangements may nonetheless present increased exposure to possible attacks,
thereby increasing the risk of a data security compromise.

To date we have not experienced any cyber-attacks, breaches or disruptions of our information
systems resulting in any material impact to our business; however, the ultimate impact of future and similar events remains unknown, and we expect additional vulnerabilities to arise. Any adverse impact to the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of our information technology systems and confidential information, including security breaches and cyber-attacks, whether at our Company, our suppliers and vendors or other third parties, could expose us to loss, unauthorized release
or disclosure of customer, employee or Company confidential information, litigation (such as class actions), investigation, regulatory enforcement action, penalties and fines, orders to stop any alleged noncompliant activity, information technology
system failures or network disruptions, increased cyber-protection and remediation costs, financial losses, potential liability, or loss of customers’, employees’ or third-party providers’ trust and business, any of which could
adversely impact our reputation, competitiveness and financial performance. An attack could also cause material service disruptions to our internal systems or, in extreme circumstances, infiltration into, damage to or loss of control of our
customers’ energy infrastructure systems. Any such breach or disruption could subject us to material liabilities, cause damage to our reputation or customer relationships, or result in regulatory investigations or other actions by governmental
authorities, which



29





Table of Contents

could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur additional costs related to the investigation and reporting of any
such breach or disruption. Additionally, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage information technology systems change frequently and are generally not identifiable until they are launched against a target, we are
unable to anticipate all attacker techniques or to implement comprehensive preventative measures, particularly because threat actors are increasingly using tools, including artificial intelligence (“AI”), that are designed to circumvent
controls and evade detection. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. Furthermore,
we cannot guarantee that any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms
or at all.

Any deterioration in the quality or reputation of our brands, which can be exacerbated by the effect of social media or significant
media coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our brands and our reputation
are among our most important assets, and our ability to attract and retain customers, as well as qualified employees, depends on brand recognition and reputation. Such dependence makes our business susceptible to reputational damage and to
competition from other companies. A variety of events could result in damage to our reputation or brands, some of which are outside of our control, including:





•




acts or omissions that adversely affect our business such as a crime, scandal, cyber-related incident, litigation
or other negative publicity;





•




failure to successfully perform, or negative publicity related to, a high-profile project;





•




actual or potential involvement in a catastrophic fire, explosion, mechanical failure of infrastructure or
similar event; or





•




actual or perceived responsibility for a serious accident or injury.

Increased media coverage and interest in energy transition matters and our industry, along with the intensification of media coverage generally, including
through the considerable expansion in the use of social media, have increased the volume and speed at which negative publicity arising from these events can be generated and spread, and we may be unable to timely respond to, correct any inaccuracies
in, or adequately address negative perceptions arising from such media coverage. In addition, negative publicity relating to certain projects may result in increased regulatory scrutiny, adverse rulings or regulatory actions. If the reputation or
perceived quality of our brands decline, customers lose confidence in us or we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees, such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


The loss of, or our inability to attract or keep, key personnel could disrupt our business.

We depend on the continued efforts of our senior management team and key technical personnel. We also depend on our ability to attract key operational,
professional and technical personnel as we grow our business and in order to establish and maintain an effective succession planning process. A shortage of these employees for various reasons, including intense competition for highly skilled
individuals with technical expertise, labor shortages, increased labor costs and the preference of some candidates to work remotely, could jeopardize our ability to successfully manage our decentralized operations or our ability to grow and expand
our business. The loss of key personnel, as well as our inability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees could negatively impact our ability to manage our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our inability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy may have an adverse impact on our growth.


Our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industry we serve and adjacent industries through strategic acquisitions of companies
that complement or enhance our business. The number of acquisition targets



30





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



that meet our criteria may be limited. We may also face competition for acquisition opportunities, and other potential acquirers may offer more favorable terms or have greater financial resources
available for potential acquisitions. This competition may further limit our acquisition opportunities or raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive, or possibly not accretive, to us. Furthermore, the increased antitrust scrutiny
of and compliance requirements for potential acquisitions, including by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act (each as amended) or other applicable
laws, could negatively impact the cost and timing of or our ability to complete certain potential acquisitions. Failure to consummate future acquisitions could negatively affect our growth strategies.

Additionally, our past acquisitions have involved, and our future acquisitions may involve, significant cash expenditures or stock issuances, the incurrence
or assumption of debt and other known and unknown liabilities and exposure to burdensome regulatory requirements. We may also discover previously unknown liabilities or, due to market conditions, be required pursuant to specific transaction terms to
assume certain prior known liabilities associated with an acquired business, and we may have inadequate or no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions or representation and warranty insurance coverage (due to policy terms or lack of
coverage at rates we believe are reasonable). Known liabilities may also change over time and become more severe than previously anticipated. As a result, past or future acquisitions may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The success of our acquisition strategy also depends on our ability to successfully conduct diligence and
integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations and realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations, expansion into new, complementary or adjacent
business lines, elimination of redundant costs and capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities. Our ability to integrate and realize benefits can be negatively impacted by, among other things:





•




failure to adequately perform necessary diligence on prospective acquisitions;





•




failure of an acquired business to achieve the results we expect;





•




diversion of our management’s attention from operational and other matters or other potential disruptions to
our existing business;





•




difficulties incorporating the operations and personnel, or inability to retain key personnel, of an acquired
business;





•




the complexities and difficulties associated with managing our business as it grows and evolves;






•




additional financial reporting and accounting challenges associated with an acquired business;






•




unanticipated events or liabilities associated with the operations of an acquired business;






•




loss of business due to customer overlap or other factors; and





•




risks and liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, such as performance,
operational, safety, cybersecurity, environmental, workforce or other compliance or tax issues, some of which we may not have discovered or accurately estimated during our due diligence and may not be covered by indemnification obligations or
insurance.

We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully complete the integration process without substantial costs, delays,
disruptions or other operational or financial problems. Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, we also generally require that key management and former principals of the businesses we acquire agree to

non-compete
covenants in the purchase agreement or, as applicable, employment agreements. Enforceability of these
non-competition
agreements varies by jurisdiction and
typically is dependent upon specific facts and circumstances, making it difficult to predict their enforceability. Additionally, the FTC has



31





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



adopted new rules to, among other things, prohibit and make unenforceable any post-employment
non-compete
arrangement that restricts an employee or
individual independent contractor, unless such arrangement was entered into in connection with an acquisition and meets certain conditions. While these rules have been challenged judicially and their implementation has been stayed, if the rules are
ultimately upheld, we might be subject to increased competition if the restrictive covenants entered into by key management personnel of acquired businesses are not enforceable or have expired, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be unable to compete for projects if we are not able to obtain surety bonds,
letters of credit or bank guarantees.

A portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees
or other financial assurances, including parent guarantees. Current or future market conditions, including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies, as well as changes in our sureties’
assessment of our operating and financial risk, could cause our surety providers and lenders to decline to issue or renew, or substantially reduce the amount of, bid or performance bonds for our work and could increase our costs associated with
collateral. These actions could be taken on short notice. If our surety providers or lenders were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding, letters of credit or guarantees, our alternatives would include seeking capacity from other sureties and
lenders or finding more business that does not require bonds or that allows for other forms of collateral for project performance, such as cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all, which
could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue or continue bonds on a

project-by-project
basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing bonds. If we
were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that require bonding.

Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to provide parent guarantees of certain obligations and liabilities of our subsidiaries that may arise in
connection with, among other things, contracts with customers, equipment lease obligations and contractor licenses. These guarantees may cover all of the subsidiary’s unperformed, undischarged and unreleased obligations and liabilities under or
in connection with the relevant agreement. For example, with respect to customer contracts, a parent guarantee may cover a variety of obligations and liabilities arising during the ordinary course of the subsidiary’s business or operations,
including, among other things, warranty and breach of contract claims, third party and environmental liabilities arising from the subsidiary’s work and for which it is responsible, liquidated damages, or indemnity claims. To the extent a
subsidiary incurs an obligation or liability that we have guaranteed, the recovery by a customer or other counterparty or a third party will not be limited to the assets of the subsidiary and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We are generally paid in arrears for our services and may enter into other arrangements with certain
of our customers, which could subject us to potential credit or investment risk and the risk of client defaults.

We are generally paid in arrears
for our services and if we or our customers are unable to meet contractual requirements, we may experience delays in collection of and/or be unable to collect our client balances. While we take precautions against default on payment for these
services (such as credit analysis and advance billing of clients), such precautions may fail to mitigate our exposure to clients’ credit risk, and we may experience significant uncollectible receivables from our clients. If we are unable to
collect our receivables or unbilled services it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our customers typically withhold some portion of amounts due to us as retainage until a project is complete.
In addition, we have provided in the past and may provide in the future other forms of financing, such as agreeing to defer payment until certain project milestones have been met. These payment arrangements subject us to potential credit risk
related to changes in business and economic factors affecting our customers. Often, in the case of EPC contracts and O&M service contracts, our counterparties (customers) are special purpose vehicles whose only assets are the project under
development or operation. In this case, we typically request a parent guarantee, letters of credit or evidence of financial close for the project from the customer. If we are unable to collect amounts owed, or retain amounts paid to us, our cash
flows are reduced and we could experience losses. Business and economic factors resulting in financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) for our customers (or their guarantors if applicable) can also reduce the value of any financing or equity
investment arrangements we have with our customers, thereby increasing the risk of loss in those circumstances. Losses experienced as a result of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Insurance and claims expenses, as well as the unavailability or cancelation of third-party insurance coverage, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We maintain insurance with insurance carriers for potential losses
arising out of our business and operations, and such insurance is subject to high deductibles. We renew our third-party insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of coverage offered may change in future periods, and
there is no assurance that any of our coverages will be renewed at their current levels or at all or that any future coverage will be available at reasonable and competitive rates. In connection with such renewals, we evaluate the level of insurance
coverage and adjust insurance levels based on risk tolerance, risk volatility, and premium expense. Our insurance coverages may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all claims and liabilities asserted against us, and if
we are not fully insured against such claims and liabilities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our insurance policies include various coverage requirements, including the requirement to give appropriate notice under the policy. If we fail to comply with
these requirements, our coverage could be denied. Losses under our insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from
third-party actuaries. Insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties and the number of
incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends.

Further, there has been a wave of blockbuster, or
so-called
“nuclear”, verdicts resulting from liabilities arising out of vehicle and other accidents in recent years. Given the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess
insurance carriers is decreasing, and the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly. For these reasons, our insurance and claims expenses may increase.

Although we reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience, estimating the
number and severity of claims, as well as related costs to settle or resolve them, is inherently difficult and subject to a high degree of variability, and such costs could exceed our reserve estimates. Accordingly, our actual losses associated with
insured claims may differ materially from our reserve estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business and results of operations are subject to physical risks including those associated with climate change.

Changes in climate have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, among other things, increasing mean annual temperatures, rising sea levels and changes
to meteorological and hydrological patterns, as well as



33

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



impacts to the frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme temperatures, storms and severe weather-related events and natural disasters. We are also subject to
physical risks such as earthquakes and landslides, such as in active earthquake zones in California. These risks extend to certain facilities and suppliers operating in the same region or in other locations that are susceptible to natural disasters,
which could cause significant business interruptions, or damage or destroy our facilities, our suppliers’, or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of our suppliers. These changes have and could continue to significantly impact our future
results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we seek to mitigate our risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related
risks regardless of how and where we conduct our operations. For example, catastrophic natural disasters can negatively impact projects we are working on, our facilities and other physical locations, portions of our equipment, or the locations and
service regions of our customers. Accordingly, a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our customers’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume
operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of coverage, legal liability and reputational losses, and we expect that increasing physical climate-related impacts may result in further changes to the cost or availability of insurance in
the future.

Physical risks associated with climate change have also increased hazards associated with our operations, which in turn has increased the
potential for liability and increased the costs associated with our operations. For example, as discussed above, severe weather events could result in a delay of our operations and could cause severe damage to equipment used in our projects and/or
our customers’ assets. In addition, the risk of wildfires in some of the areas where we operate has exposed us and other contractors and O&M service providers to increased risk of liability in connection with our operations in those
locations, as these events can be started by electrical power and other infrastructure on which we have performed services. Given the potentially significant liabilities associated with any of these events, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, these climate conditions could also result in increased costs for third-party insurance and reduce the amount insurance carriers are willing to make available to us under such
policies.

Our business is subject to operational hazards, including, among others, damage from severe weather conditions and electrical hazards,
that can result in significant liabilities, and we may not be insured against all potential liabilities.

Due to the nature of our services and
certain of our product solutions, as well as the conditions in which we and our customers operate, our business is subject to operational hazards and accidents that can result in significant liabilities. These operational hazards include, among
other things, electrocution, explosions, leaks, collisions, mechanical failures, and damage from severe weather conditions and natural disasters such as extreme temperatures, flooding or severe rain or hail. Furthermore, certain operational hazards
have become more widespread in recent years due to changes in climate and other factors, and certain of our customers operate in locations and environments that increase the likelihood and/or severity of these operational hazards.

Our projects are subject to the risk of damage and disruption which are caused by severe weather events (such as extreme cold weather, hail, hurricanes,
tornadoes and heavy snowfall), seismic activity, fires, floods and other natural disasters or catastrophic events, which could result in a project delay and could cause severe damage to equipment used in our projects and/or our customers’
assets. Any of these events would negatively impact our ability to deliver our services to our customers and could result in reduced demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

Events arising from operational hazards and accidents have resulted in significant liabilities to us in the past and may expose us
to significant claims and liabilities in the future. These claims and liabilities can arise through indemnification obligations to customers, our negligence or otherwise, and such claims and liabilities can arise even if our operations are not the
cause of the harm. We also perform site-work services and construction services, as well as services on other infrastructure assets, and failure of, or accidents with respect to work we

perform on, any of these types of assets could result in significant claims or liabilities. Our exposure to liability can also extend for years after we complete our services, and potential
claims and liabilities arising from significant accidents and events can take years and significant legal costs to resolve.

Potential liabilities
include, among other things, claims associated with personal injury, including severe injury or loss of life, and destruction of or significant damage to property and equipment (with respect to both our customers and other third parties), as well as
harm to the environment, and other claims discussed above. These potential liabilities could lead to suspension of operations, adverse effects to our safety record and reputation and/or material liabilities and legal costs. In addition, if any of
these events or related losses are alleged or found to be the result of our or our customers’ activities or services, we could be subject to government enforcement actions, regulatory penalties, civil litigation and governmental actions,
including investigations, citations, fines and suspension of operations. Insurance coverage may not be available to us or may be insufficient to cover the cost of any of these liabilities and legal costs, and our insurance costs may increase if we
incur liabilities associated with operational hazards. If we are not fully insured or indemnified against such liabilities and legal costs or a counterparty fails to meet its indemnification obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, to the extent our reputation or safety record is adversely affected, demand for our services could decline or we may not be able to bid for certain work.

Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from various stakeholders with respect to corporate sustainability practices may impose additional costs
on us or expose us to reputational or other risks.

Investors, customers and other stakeholders have focused on sustainability practices of
companies, including, among other things, practices with respect to human capital resources, emissions and environmental impact and political spending. Expectations and requirements of our investors, customers and other stakeholders evolve rapidly
and are largely out of our control, and our initiatives and disclosures in response to such expectations and requirements may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement,
contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain services, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other material adverse effects to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there has been an
increase in activism, media attention, and litigation related to such matters. While we have programs and initiatives in place related to our sustainability practices, investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result
of their assessment of our practices, and there is no guarantee that our programs and initiatives will have the desired outcomes, or that we will be successful in achieving related goals or targets that we may set. Failure or a perception of failure
to implement corporate sustainability practices or achieve sustainability goals and targets we have set, or that we have set them at all, could damage our reputation, causing investors or customers to lose confidence and negatively impact the
business. In addition, our customers may require that we implement certain additional procedures or standards in order to continue to do business with us. A failure to comply with investor, customer and other stakeholder expectations and standards,
which are evolving and can conflict, or if we are perceived not to have responded appropriately to their growing concerns around sustainability issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, could also cause reputational harm
to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, if a portion of our operations are perceived to result in high greenhouse gas emissions, our reputation could
suffer. In addition, organizations that provide ratings information to investors on sustainability matters may assign unfavorable ratings to us or our industry, which may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other
companies or industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our costs of capital.

Moreover, while we may create and publish
voluntary disclosures regarding sustainability matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and estimates and assumptions that may not be representative of current or actual
risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines
involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many sustainability matters. In addition,



35

we expect there will likely be increasing levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to sustainability matters. For example, certain jurisdictions in which we operate
have adopted new requirements that would require companies to provide expanded emissions-related disclosures on an annual basis. Additionally, the State of California has enacted rules that require companies to provide significantly expanded
climate-related disclosures, whereas other jurisdictions have attempted to impose conflicting regulations. While certain of these rules are subject to ongoing legal challenges, these new and proposed regulatory requirements may require us to incur
significant additional costs to comply, including the implementation of significant additional internal controls processes and procedures regarding matters that have not been subject to such controls in the past, may subject us to fines or penalties
for noncompliance, and may impose increased oversight obligations on our management and board of directors, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our unionized workforce and related obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


As of December 31, 2024, approximately 10% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The number of our employees
covered by collective bargaining agreements could increase in the future for a variety of reasons, including acquisitions, unionization of a
non-union
operating company, project requirements (e.g., project
labor agreements) and changes in law. The political and labor environment in recent years has also generally been more conducive to unionization attempts, and we have experienced an increase in unionization attempts at certain of our operating
companies and expect such attempts to continue in the future. For a variety of reasons, our unionized workforce could adversely impact relationships with our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Certain of our customers also require or prefer a
non-union
workforce, and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our
non-union

labor crews become unionized. Additionally, although the majority of the collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, certain of our unionized employees have participated in strikes and work stoppages in the past and strikes
or work stoppages could occur in the future. Our ability to complete future acquisitions also could be adversely affected because of our operating companies’ union status, including because our union agreements may be incompatible with the
union agreements of a business we want to acquire or because a business we want to acquire may not want to become affiliated with our operating companies that have employees covered by collective bargaining obligations.

Our collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multiemployer pension plans. To the extent a plan is
underfunded, we may be subject to substantial liabilities under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (“MEPA”) if we withdraw or are
deemed to withdraw from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal, and we have been involved in several litigation matters associated with withdrawal liabilities in the past. Further, the Pension Protection Act of 2006
added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to multiemployer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example,
the plan’s funded percentage, cash flow position and a projected minimum funding deficiency). Plans in these classifications must adopt remedial measures, which may require additional contributions from employers (e.g., a surcharge on benefit
contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which we contribute or may contribute in the future have these funding statuses, and we may be obligated to contribute material amounts to these plans in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our inability to maintain, protect or enforce
our rights in intellectual property could adversely affect our business.

Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to maintain,
protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including rights in our proprietary software platforms. Any failure to maintain, protect or enforce our



36





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar services more quickly than anticipated, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our
competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on
intellectual property laws, primarily a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S., as well as contractual restrictions in our confidentiality, license and other agreements with our employees, consultants and other third
parties with whom we have a relationship to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information may not adequately secure our intellectual
property rights. We cannot be certain our agreements will not be breached, including a breach involving the use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of any
breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or lose trade secret protection.

We cannot be certain that we will be able to assert
our intellectual property rights successfully in the future or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Third parties may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. Monitoring unauthorized
use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and the steps we have taken or may take in the future in an effort to prevent infringement, misappropriation or other violation may not be successful. From time to time, we may have to resort
to litigation to enforce our intellectual property, which could result in significant costs and diversion of our management’s attention and other resources.

In addition, we cannot be certain that our competitors will not independently develop same or similar technology, obtain information we regard as proprietary,
or design around intellectual property rights of ours. Any failure by us to adequately protect or enforce our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights could adversely affect business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to
pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.

We cannot be certain the conduct of our business does not or will
not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of a third party. Third parties, including our competitors, may currently own or obtain in the future patents or other intellectual property rights that cover aspects
of our proprietary technology or business methods. Such parties may claim we have misappropriated, misused, infringed or otherwise violated third-party intellectual property rights and if we gain greater recognition in the market, we face a higher
risk of being the subject of claims we have violated others’ intellectual property rights. Any claim we violated a third party’s intellectual property rights, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to settle or
litigate and could divert our management’s attention and other resources, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we do not successfully settle or defend an intellectual property
claim, we could be liable for significant monetary damages and could be prohibited from continuing to use certain technology, business methods, content or brands. To avoid a prohibition, we could seek a license from third parties, which could
require us to pay significant royalties, increasing our operating expenses. If a license is not available at all or not available on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to develop or license a

non-violating
alternative, either of which could adversely affect business, financial condition and results of operations.

We use AI technologies in our business, and the deployment, use, and maintenance of these technologies involve significant technological and legal
risks.

We use AI technologies in our business, and we are making investments to continuously evaluate, develop, deploy, use, maintain, and
improve our use of such technologies. The market for AI technologies is rapidly evolving and these technologies are yet to become widely accepted in many industries, including the solar and renewable energy industry. We cannot be sure that the
market will continue to grow or that it will grow in ways



37

we anticipate. We are in varying stages of evaluation and implementation in relation to AI technologies, and we may not be successful in our ongoing development of these technologies in the face
of novel and evolving technical, reputational, and market factors. We currently leverage a small number of mainstream, third-party AI tools, primarily including Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT Enterprise, and are in early stages of working with
third-party vendors and consultants to further develop our AI strategy. We have not initiated the development of any proprietary AI technology.

Our
use of AI could also result in unintended consequences. For example, AI algorithms and models that are used may have undisclosed inherent limitations, be flawed or contain errors or may be based on datasets that are biased, outdated, collected in
violation of applicable laws, or insufficient.

We also face competition in relation to the evaluation, development, deployment, use, maintenance, and
improvement of AI technologies. Our competitors or our customers may develop or use technologies that are similar or superior to ours, are more cost-effective, or are quicker to develop and deploy. Our failure to successfully commercialize product
offerings involving AI technologies, or our failure to offer or deploy new technologies as effectively, as quickly or as cost-efficiently as our competitors, could impair our ability to expand our business and deliver value to our customers. We
expect that increased investment will be required in the future to continuously implement data-driven solutions and improve our use of AI technologies.

The technologies underlying AI and its use cases are rapidly developing, and remain subject to existing laws, including privacy, consumer protection and
federal equal opportunity laws. As a result, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational or technological risks related to the use of AI. Such uncertainty in the legal regulatory regime relating to AI, such as evolving review by
agencies including the SEC and the FTC, may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with U.S. and
non-U.S.
laws and regulations, the nature of which cannot be
determined at this time.

As with many technological innovations, there are significant risks involved in evaluating, developing, deploying, using,
maintaining and improving these technologies, and there can be no assurance that the usage of or our investments in such technologies will always enhance our data-driven solutions or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or
profitability. Any of the foregoing, together with developing guidance and/or decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI and our ability to provide and improve our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations
and processes, and result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks around the development and use of AI technologies could
adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Industry

Negative macroeconomic conditions and industry-specific market conditions can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Stagnant or deteriorating economic conditions, including a prolonged economic downturn or recession, as well as significant
events that have an impact on financial or capital markets, can adversely impact the demand for our services and result in the delay, reduction or cancelation of certain projects. Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slow growth or
recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, changes in global trade relationships, and tighter credit and higher interest rates could materially and adversely affect demand for our services and the availability and cost of the materials and
equipment that we need to deliver our services or that our customers need for their projects. During periods of elevated economic uncertainty, our customers may reduce or eliminate their spending on the services we provide. In addition, volatility
in the debt or equity markets, as well as prolonged higher interest rates, may negatively impact our customers’ access to or willingness to raise capital and result in the reduction or elimination of spending on the services we provide. Our
vendors, suppliers and subcontractors may also be, to varying degrees, adversely affected by these conditions. These conditions, which can develop rapidly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.



38

A number of factors can also adversely affect the power industry, including, among other things, prevailing
power prices, the economic impact of supply chain and other logistical issues, financing conditions, potential bankruptcies, global and U.S. trade relationships, changes in regulations, including modifications to tax credits and renewable energy
mandates, and other geopolitical conflicts and other events. A reduction in cash flows or the lack of availability of debt or equity financing for our customers on favorable terms could result in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our
services and also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Consolidation, competition, capital constraints or negative
economic conditions in the renewable energy industry can also result in reduced spending by, or the loss of, one or more of our customers.

Our business
is also exposed to risks associated with the renewable energy industry. These risks, which are not subject to our control, including power prices, the availability and attractiveness of incentives for renewable energy, the demand for renewable
energy sources, including improvements in the affordability and efficiency of traditional and novel electric generation technologies, and legislative and regulatory actions, as well as public opinion, regarding the impact of fossil fuels on the
climate and environment. Specifically, lower power prices, or perceived risk thereof, can result in decreased or delayed spending by our customers.

Projects in our industry can have long sales cycles requiring significant upfront investment of resources which, if they do not result in a project,
could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The sales cycles for our customers’ projects vary
substantially and can take many months or years to mature. As a result of these long sales cycles, we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources (including, for example, sales and marketing, engineering and research and
development expenses) in advance of the signing of EPC contracts, commencing construction, and recognizing any revenue, which may not be recognized for several additional months following contract signing. Our potential inability to enter into
contracts with potential customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Our revenues and profitability can be negatively impacted if our customers encounter financial difficulties or file bankruptcy or
disputes arise with our customers.

Our contracts often require us to satisfy or achieve certain milestones in order to receive payment, or in the
case of cost-reimbursable contracts, provide support for billings in advance of payment. As a result, we could be required to incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of work prior to receipt of payment. We could face difficulties
collecting payment and sometimes fail to receive payment for such costs in circumstances where our customers do not proceed to project completion, terminate or cancel a contract, default on their payment obligations, or dispute the adequacy of our
billing support. We have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to the payment terms of our contracts, and any such claims may harm our relationships with our customers.

Slowing economic conditions in the power industry can also impair the financial condition of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely
basis or at all. To the extent a customer files bankruptcy, payment of amounts owed can be delayed and certain payments we receive prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition may be avoided and returned to the customer’s bankruptcy estate.
Furthermore, many of our customers for larger projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and could be more likely to encounter financial difficulties relating to their
businesses. We ultimately may be unable to collect amounts owed to us by customers experiencing financial difficulties or in bankruptcy, and accounts receivable from such customers may become uncollectible and ultimately have to be written off,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could negatively affect our business.


We cannot be certain that we will maintain or enhance our competitive position or maintain our current customer base. Our industry is served by
numerous companies, from small, owner-operated private companies to large multi-national, public companies. Relatively few barriers prevent entry into some areas of our business, and as a result, any organization that has adequate financial
resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors. In addition, some of our competitors have significant financial, technical and marketing resources, and may have or develop expertise, experience and resources to provide
services that are superior in both price and quality to our services. Certain of our competitors may also have lower overhead cost structures, and therefore may be able to provide services at lower rates than us. Additionally, many of our existing
or prospective customers are now capable, or may in the future become capable, of performing the same types of O&M services we provide, and these customers may also face pressure or be compelled to self-perform an increasing amount of the
services we currently perform for them, thereby reducing the services they outsource to us in the future.

We also subcontract certain of our services,
including pursuant to customer and regulatory requirements, and certain of these subcontractors may develop into a competitor to us on prime contracts with our customers. Our subcontracting requirements have also increased in recent years, primarily
as a result of these customer and regulatory requirements, which not only increases the number of viable competitors but could also negatively impact our ability to self-perform projects.

Furthermore, a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly dependent upon obtaining new contracts, which is unpredictable and often involves
complex and lengthy negotiations and bidding processes that are impacted by a wide variety of factors, including, among other things, price, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions, overall market
and economic conditions, and a potential customer’s perception of our ability to perform the work or the technological advantages held by our competitors. The competitive environment we operate in can also affect the timing of contract awards
and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. For example, based on rapidly changing competition and market dynamics, we have recently experienced, and may in the future experience, more competitive pricing for smaller scale
projects. Additionally, changing competitive pressures present difficulties in matching workforce size with available contract awards. As a result of the factors described above, the competitive environment we operate in could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Technological advancements in other forms of power generation could
negatively affect our business.

Technological advancements in other forms of power generation could result in reduced investment in solar and
battery storage projects and reduced demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, if other forms of power generation, including natural gas, nuclear,
coal or other renewable energy technologies, are able to generate and deliver electricity at lower cost or with improved operational and/or environmental efficiency, relative to solar and battery storage projects, demand for our services could be
significantly reduced. Additionally, any technological advancements may result in increased investment in other forms of power generation in lieu of investment in our industry, which could result in changing customer priorities and lead to reduced
demand.

Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these and other potential changes in a cost-effective manner
and to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. Our failure to do so or the incurrence of significant expenditures in adapting to such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, we view our portfolio of energized services tools and techniques, as well as our other process and
design technologies, as competitive strengths, which we believe differentiate our service offerings. If our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, through technological advancements or



40

otherwise, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Regulation and Compliance

Regulatory requirements applicable to our industry and changes in current and potential legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect
demand for our services.

The federal, state and local regulations affecting the power industry, including, among other things, environmental,
health, safety, and permitting requirements and materials sourcing and transportation obligations, have a material effect on our business. These regulations are complex and subject to change both in substance and interpretation and often regulations
across various jurisdictions can differ or conflict, all of which can negatively impact our or our customers’ ability to efficiently operate. In recent years, customers in our industry have faced heightened regulatory requirements and increased
regulatory enforcement, as well as private legal challenges related to compliance with such regulatory requirements, which have resulted in delays, reductions in scope and cancelations of projects. Furthermore, we are subject to certain regulatory
requirements applicable to our customers, and our inability to meet those requirements could result in decreased demand for our services. Increased and changing regulatory requirements applicable to us and our customers have resulted in, among other
things, project delays and decreased demand for our services in the past, and may do so in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

For example, in the past, sourcing restrictions on critical components for our customers’ projects have resulted in supply chain and logistical
challenges, which negatively impacted certain of our services. We may be impacted in the future by sourcing restrictions, including, but not limited to, taxes, tariffs and duties, which may negatively impact project timing within certain of our
markets in the future. Furthermore, with respect to our contracts under which we are responsible for procuring all or a portion of the materials needed for projects, including our EPC contracts, we are often required to comply with complex sourcing
and transportation regulations, which can involve cross-border movement of such materials. Changes to, or our failure to comply with, these regulatory requirements can result in project delays and additional project costs, which may be substantial
and not recoverable from third parties, and in some cases, we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays, including in circumstances where we have guaranteed project completion or performance by a scheduled date and incur liquidated
damages if we do not meet such schedule. Our failure to comply with these regulatory requirements, including reliability standards promulgated by the designated Electric Reliability Organization (which is currently NERC), could result in criminal or
civil fines, penalties, forfeitures or other sanctions.

Regulatory requirements focused on concerns about climate-change related issues, including any
new or changed requirements concerning the reduction, production or consumption of fossil fuels, could negatively impact the production volumes of our customers, which could in turn negatively impact demand for certain of our services. Additionally,
new regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources could also significantly increase costs for our large fleet of vehicles, render portions of our fleet of vehicles obsolete or reduce the availability of vehicles we need to
perform our services. Laws, regulations and existing policies related to climate change and to greenhouse gas emissions have been rapidly evolving and are increasingly difficult to predict, particularly in light of recent announcements and actions
by the U.S. government to reconsider
air-related
regulations and policies.

With respect to certain services
within our business, current and potential legislative or regulatory initiatives may be amended or repealed or may not be implemented or extended or result in incremental increased demand for our services, including the IRA, the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”), legislation or regulation that mandates percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources, requires utilities to meet reliability standards, provides for existing or new production tax
credits for renewable energy developers, or encourages installation of new electric power transmission and renewable energy generation facilities. While these actions



41

and initiatives have positively impacted demand for our services in the past, it is not certain whether they will continue to do so in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We or our customers benefit from certain
government subsidies and economic incentives from time to time, including renewable energy tax credits, rebates and other incentives that support the development and adoption of clean energy solutions. For example, the IRA introduced and extended a
number of federal tax credits to promote clean energy development. The IRA has driven significant investments in clean energy developments since its enactment and thereby increased demand from our customers for our services. However, due to recent
actions taken by the U.S. presidential administration and U.S. Congress, it is uncertain whether our customers will be able to benefit from such programs and subsidies (or comparable ones) or that these programs and subsidies will continue to be
available to them.

Further, government incentives are subject to uncertainties and may be discontinued, repealed or amended at any time. Any
reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives that would otherwise be available to our customers because of policy changes, or the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the
perceived success of clean and renewable energy products, new U.S. presidential administration and its focus on the development of more traditional energy generation projects or other reasons, may require our customers to seek additional financing,
which may not be obtainable on commercially attractive terms or at all, or abandon or not proceed with projects and may result in the diminished competitiveness of the solar and renewable energy industry generally or our business in particular. In
addition, any change in the level of subsidies and incentives from which we benefit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to complex federal, state and other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or
feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities.

Our operations are subject to a complex and rapidly evolving set
of federal, state, local and international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws govern the generation, use, storage, release, management and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, the remediation of
contaminated sites, fuel storage, wastewater and stormwater discharges, air emissions, the protection of natural resources (such as protected wetlands or threatened and endangered species and their habitat) and occupational health and safety. These
laws, rules and regulations require us to obtain and maintain regulatory licenses, permits and other approvals, comply with the requirements of such licenses, permits and other approvals and perform environmental impact studies prior to commencing
new projects or making changes to existing projects. Additionally, as a company with a focus on ESG and sustainability, noncompliance with environmental laws, rules or regulations can also significantly harm our reputation. We could be held liable
for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations or be subject to revocation of certain licenses or permits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We perform work, including directional drilling, in and around environmentally sensitive areas such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Due to the
inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible that such work may cause the release of subsurface materials that contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines.
For example, the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”) and comparable state laws and regulations applicable to our construction activities require us to establish authorization for the discharge of stormwater, which may require the development and
implementation of a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (“SWPPP”) to describe the construction activities and the pollution prevention practices that will be implemented in connection with those activities.



42

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



Additionally, we lease numerous properties and facilities, including certain of which that contain
above-and
below-ground fuel storage tanks or otherwise involve operations including the generation, use, storage or management of hazardous materials and wastes. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held
responsible for costs (including remediation costs and fines) relating to contamination at our past or present properties and facilities. Although we maintain environmental insurance policies to address certain environmental risks, we can give no
assurance that we will be able to maintain such policies in the future or that such policies will cover the full cost of environmental liabilities. The obligations, liabilities, fines and costs associated with these events and conditions may be
material and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, new or amended laws and
regulations, changes in the interpretation of existing laws and increased regulatory scrutiny could require us to incur significant costs or result in new or increased liabilities. For instance, changes to the definition of “waters of the
United States” by the Environmental Protection Agency may broaden the scope of the CWA, potentially impacting construction activities near certain waterways. In some cases, we have obtained indemnification and other rights from third parties
(including predecessors or lessors) for such obligations and liabilities; however, these indemnities may not cover all of our costs and indemnitors may fail to fulfill their financial obligations to us. Further, in connection with an acquisition, we
may not identify all potential environmental liabilities associated with the acquired business. Such uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain regulatory requirements applicable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Following this offering, we will be subject to various specific regulatory regimes and requirements that could result in significant compliance
costs and liabilities. As a public company, we will be subject to various corporate governance and financial reporting requirements, including requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our
independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion on the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls, including the identification and remediation of
significant internal control deficiencies in acquired businesses (both prior acquisitions and future acquisitions), could result in a reduced ability to obtain debt and equity financing, a loss of customers, fines or penalties, and/or additional
expenditures to meet the requirements or remedy any deficiencies.

Any actual or perceived failure to comply with new or existing laws, regulations
or other requirements relating to the privacy, security and processing of personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We also collect, process and retain information that relates to individuals and/or constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,”
“personally identifiable information,” or similar terms under applicable data privacy laws, including from and about our customers, stockholders, vendors and employees. Legislation and regulatory requirements, as well as contractual
commitments, affect how we must store, use, transfer and process the confidential information of our customers, stockholders, vendors and employees. The application and interpretation of such requirements are constantly evolving and are subject to
change, creating a complex compliance environment. In some cases, these requirements may be either unclear in their interpretation and application or they may have inconsistent or conflicting requirements with each other. Further, there has been a
substantial increase in legislative activity and regulatory focus on data privacy and security in the United States, including in relation to cybersecurity incidents. These laws, as well as other new or changing legislative, regulatory or
contractual requirements concerning data privacy and protection, could require us to expend significant additional compliance costs, implement new processes, or change our handling of information and business operations, and any failure or perceived
failure to comply with such requirements can result in significant liability legal claims or proceedings (including class actions), regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or harm to our reputation. In addition, we could incur significant
costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages

or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in tax laws or our tax estimates or positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We are or will be subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes
(excise/duty, sales/use, gross receipts, and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes, and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws, treaties and regulations and changes in existing tax laws, treaties and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed, all of which can result in significant changes to the tax rate on our earnings and have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. For example, under currently proposed legislation,
certain investment tax credits and productions tax credits may no longer be available for projects that do not start construction within a certain specified period of time after the legislations’ passage, and/or achieve placement in service by
a specified date. Since future changes to tax legislation and regulations are unknown, we cannot predict the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision
for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are and will be regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax
positions could be materially affected by many factors, including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of
earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. A significant increase in our tax rate or change to our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

We could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with anti-corruption, anti-bribery and/or international trade laws to
which we are subject.

Applicable U.S. and
non-U.S.
anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including but
not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibit us from, among other things, corruptly making payments to
non-U.S.
officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
business. We pursue certain opportunities in countries that experience government corruption, and in certain circumstances, compliance with these laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable
anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and our procedures and practices are designed to ensure that our employees and intermediaries comply with these laws. However, it is possible that our employees, subcontractors, agents and partners may take
actions in violation of our policies, company-wide standards, procedures and anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and that the controls we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include internal control policies, could be intentionally
circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions. Liability for such actions or inadvertences could result in severe criminal or civil fines, penalties, forfeitures, disgorgements or other sanctions, which in turn could have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be expensive and consume significant time and attention of our
senior management,
in-country
management, and other personnel.

Additionally, pursuant to our EPC and other
contracts where we have assumed responsibility to procure all or part of the materials needed for certain projects, we may source materials from outside the U.S. and be subject to
non-U.S.
laws associated with
the procurement and transportation of such materials. The laws and regulations associated with such cross-border procurement activities are complex and our failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in criminal or civil fines,
penalties, sanctions or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Violations of export control and/or economic sanctions laws and regulations to which we are subject and
changes to U.S. foreign trade policy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we cannot predict the impact to our business or the future development of such laws and regulations.


Our services may be subject to export control regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of
Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We are also subject to foreign assets control and economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which restrict or prohibit
our ability to transact with certain foreign countries, individuals and entities. Export control regulations may restrict our ability to exchange technical information with foreign manufacturers and suppliers and economic sanctions regulations may
restrict our ability to source from certain suppliers. In addition, in the future we may conduct business outside of the U.S. We will consider these scenarios when designing our policies and procedures and conducting training designed to facilitate
compliance with U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Although we believe our policies and procedures will mitigate the risk of violations of such laws, our employees and intermediaries may take actions in violation of our
policies or these laws. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In addition, changes in U.S. foreign policy, including as a result of the new presidential administration, could lead to
additional export barriers or economic sanctions being imposed against foreign jurisdictions. Any such change in U.S. foreign policy could restrict or prohibit our ability to transact with, source from or export to certain foreign countries,
individuals and entities (including manufacturers and suppliers) or to conduct business outside of the U.S. We cannot predict what changes to U.S. trade policy will be made by the current presidential administration, a future presidential
administration or Congress, including whether existing tariff policies will be maintained or modified or whether the entry into new bilateral or multilateral trade agreements will occur, nor can we predict the effects that any such changes would
have on our business. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted and could again result in adverse reactions from U.S. trade partners, including the adoption by such countries of responsive trade policies that may make it more difficult or costly
for U.S. businesses to do business with suppliers and manufacturers of such countries. Changes to U.S. foreign trade policy that restrict our ability to transact with other countries, individuals or entities or to conduct business outside the U.S.
could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Immigration laws, including our inability to
verify employment eligibility, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We employ a
significant number of employees, and while we utilize processes to assist in verifying the employment eligibility of our employees so that we maintain compliance with applicable laws, it is possible some of our employees may be unauthorized workers.
The employment of unauthorized workers or failure to comply with the requirements of
non-immigrant
visas could subject us to fines, penalties and other costs, as well as result in adverse publicity that
negatively impacts our reputation and brand and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees. Immigration laws have also been an area of considerable political focus in recent years, and, from
time-to-time,
the U.S. government considers or implements changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our
obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and potential liability and make our hiring processes more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

We have substantial indebtedness and may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service such indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to
satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.

As of December 31, 2024, we had long-term debt, exclusive of
equipment financing and lease liabilities, of approximately $362.8 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Description of
Material Indebtedness” for descriptions of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and could have important consequences. For example, it could:





•




make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness;






•




increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;





•




require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness,
thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;





•




limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry, which may place us
at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;





•




restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or other investments or cause us to make
non-strategic
divestitures;





•




limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital and capital expenditures, and for other
general corporate purposes; and





•




require compliance with financial and other restrictive covenants that may restrict our ability to operate or
expand.

Our ability to make scheduled payments due on our debt obligations or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our
financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to
maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems. Any decrease in
our liquidity could result in our inability to meet financial obligations or fund growth plans, and we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or
equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to implement any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our
scheduled debt service obligations.

Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to refinance our indebtedness on
commercially reasonable terms or at all would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our
failure to comply with the covenants contained in the credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could cause repayment of our debt to be
accelerated.

The credit agreements governing the Credit Facilities impose, and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may impose,
material restrictions on us that limit our operating flexibility, which could harm our long-term interests. These restrictions, subject in certain cases to ordinary course of business and other exceptions, may limit our ability to engage in some
transactions, including the following:





•




incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;



46





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.





•




paying dividends, redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payments;





•




making payments in respect of certain subordinated indebtedness;





•




making investments, including acquisitions, loans and advances;





•




entering into burdensome agreements with negative pledge clauses or restrictions on subsidiary distributions;






•




selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of assets, properties or licenses not in the ordinary course of
business;





•




creating liens on assets and capital stock to secure any indebtedness for borrowed money;





•




undergoing a change in control;





•




merging, consolidating, liquidating, winding up or dissolving;





•




entering into new lines of business or materially altering our business and the business conducted by certain of
our subsidiaries; and





•




entering into transactions with affiliates.

In addition to imposing restrictions on our business and operations, some of our debt instruments include covenants relating to one or more financial ratios
and tests.

Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our indebtedness, and any subsequent financing agreements, including as a result of events
beyond our control, may result in an event of default under these agreements, which in turn may result in defaults or acceleration of obligations under these agreements and other agreements, giving our lenders and other debt holders the right to
terminate any commitments they may have made to provide us with further funds and to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments.
In addition, we may not be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the applicable debt. Even if we were able to secure additional financing, it may not be available on favorable terms. Any future debt that we incur may contain financial
maintenance covenants.

Despite current indebtedness levels, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. This could further
increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.

We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which would
increase our debt service obligations and could further reduce the cash available to invest in operations. The terms of our credit agreements do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to
limitations. As of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had $78.9 million of unused commitments available to be borrowed under the Revolving Facility. This amount includes no cash borrowings and is net of $11.1 million of
outstanding letters of credit. If new debt is added to our debt levels, or any debt is incurred by our subsidiaries, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries currently face could increase.

Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.

Borrowings under the agreements governing our indebtedness are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase,
our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly
decrease. Although we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, these agreements may not be effective.

Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure

Our principal asset after the completion of this offering will be our direct or indirect interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and, as a result, we will
depend on distributions from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and
restrictions.

Upon the consummation of this offering and the Transactions, we will be a holding company and will have no material assets other
than our ownership of LLC Interests. As such, we will have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, will be dependent upon
the financial results and cash flows of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. There can be no assurance that SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient
cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative covenants in the agreements governing SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s and its subsidiaries’ indebtedness, will permit such
distributions. Additionally, the terms of the credit agreements governing our Credit Facilities limit SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries from making distributions and paying dividends to us, subject to certain exceptions, which includes
the making of distributions and/or dividends after the consummation of an initial public offering or the issuance of public debt securities to pay fees and expenses in connection with being a public company. Deterioration in the financial condition,
earnings or cash flow of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries for any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition
and results of operations.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC was historically an entity disregarded as separate from SOLV
Energy Parent Holdings LP, an entity taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a disregarded entity, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC was not subject to any entity level U.S. federal income tax. In connection with the Transactions,
SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will become a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, either prior to or as a result of the acquisition of LLC Interests in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC by SOLV Energy, Inc. As a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will generally not be subject to any entity level U.S. federal income tax, and we will incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC at the prevailing corporate tax
rates. Under the terms of the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will be obligated, subject to various limitations and restrictions, including with respect to any debt instruments to which SOLV Energy Holdings LLC or any
subsidiary thereof is a party, to make tax distributions to members, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we will also incur expenses related to our operations, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (which payments we expect
could be significant). The terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement will be described in a subsequent filing. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.” We intend, as its sole managing member, to
cause SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to make cash distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to (i) fund all or part of their tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to them and (ii) cover our operating expenses,
including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, such as restrictions on distributions that would either
violate any contract or agreement to which SOLV Energy Holdings LLC is then a party, including debt instruments, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering SOLV Energy Holdings LLC insolvent. If we do not have sufficient funds
to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations (including, if applicable, as a result of any payments required to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement (including in the case of any acceleration of our obligations thereunder)), we
may have to borrow funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any lenders of such funds. In addition, if SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends will also be restricted or impaired. See “—Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock”
and “Dividend Policy.”

SOLV Energy Holdings LLC may make distributions of cash to us in excess of the amounts we use to make
distributions to our stockholders and pay our expenses (including our taxes and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement). To the extent we do not distribute such excess cash to our stockholders, the direct or indirect members in SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC may benefit from any value attributable to such cash if they acquire shares of Class A common stock in exchange for their LLC Interests.

Under the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC is generally required to make tax distributions, and we intend to cause SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC, from time to time, to make such distributions in cash to its members (including us) in amounts that are sufficient to cover such members’ taxes imposed as a result of their allocable share of the taxable income of SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC. These tax distributions may be in amounts that exceed our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, including as a result of (i) tax distributions being made on a pro rata basis based on
percentage interests regardless of potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s other members, (ii) the lower tax rate applicable to corporations as opposed to individuals,
(iii) the use of an assumed tax rate (which we expect to be based on the tax rate applicable to individuals), and (iv) certain tax benefits that we may obtain from, among other things, acquisitions of direct or indirect interests in SOLV
Energy Holdings LLC in connection with the consummation of the Transactions or in the future (including as a result of any exchange or redemptions of LLC Interests from the other members of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC) and payments under the Tax
Receivable Agreement. Our board of directors will determine the appropriate uses for any excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, the payment of obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or the payment of other expenses.
We will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash) to our stockholders. To the extent we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock, we may take other actions with respect to such
excess cash, for example, holding such excess cash, contributing such cash to SOLV Energy Holdings LLC in exchange for additional LLC Interests or lending it (or a portion thereof) to SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, some of which may result in shares of
our Class A common stock increasing in value relative to the value of LLC Interests. No adjustments to the exchange ratio for LLC Interests and corresponding shares of Class A common stock will be required to be made as a result of any
retention or distribution of cash by us. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock or otherwise take ameliorative actions between LLC Interests and shares of Class A common stock and
instead, for example, hold such cash balances, members (other than SOLV Energy, Inc.) may benefit from any value attributable to such cash balances if they acquire shares of Class A common stock in exchange for their LLC Interests,
notwithstanding that such holders may have participated previously as members in distributions that resulted in such excess cash balances.

The Tax
Receivable Agreement that we will enter into with the Continuing Equity Owners will require us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we expect that such payments will be substantial.


In connection with the consummation of this offering, we will enter into a Tax Receivable Agreement with SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and each of the
TRA Participants. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to make cash payments to the TRA Participants equal to a percentage of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize,
as a result of certain circumstances (calculated using certain assumptions). We will be required to make payments to the TRA Participants under the Tax Receivable Agreement even if all of the Continuing Equity Owners exchange or redeem their
remaining LLC Interests, and the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be conditioned upon continued ownership of our stock by the exchanging Continuing Equity Owners. The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are
obligations of SOLV Energy, Inc. and not of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. We expect that the amount of the cash payments we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Any payments made by us to the TRA Participants
under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be available for reinvestment in our business and will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. Furthermore, if we experience a change of control (as
will be defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement), which we anticipate will include, among other things, certain mergers, asset sales, and other forms of business combinations, we expect that the Tax Receivable Agreement will obligate us to

make an immediate payment, which may be significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the payment relates. This
payment obligation could (i) make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) result
in holders of our Class A common stock receiving substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Accordingly, the interests of the Continuing Equity
Owners (including those that have exchanged their LLC Interests for Class A common stock and are TRA Participants) may conflict with those of holders of our Class A common stock.

Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners that will not
benefit holders of our Class
A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit the Continuing Equity Owners.


Our organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners that will not benefit holders
of our Class A common stock to the same extent that it will benefit the Continuing Equity Owners. We will enter into the Tax Receivable Agreement with SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and each of the TRA Participants in connection with the completion
of this offering and the Transactions, which will provide for the payment by us to the TRA Participants of a percentage of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize in certain
circumstances (calculated using certain assumptions). The terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement will be described in a subsequent filing. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Tax Receivable Agreement.” Although we
will retain a percentage of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for the Class A common stock.

Additionally, we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of LLC Interests. As a consequence, our ability to declare and pay
dividends to holders of our Class A common stock is subject to the ability of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to provide distributions to us. If SOLV Energy Holdings LLC makes such distributions, the Continuing Equity Owners that hold LLC Interests
will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC on a pro rata basis. However, because we must pay taxes, amounts ultimately distributed as dividends to holders of our Class A common stock are expected to be
less on a per share basis than the amounts distributed by SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to such Continuing Equity Owners on a per unit basis. This and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for our
Class A common stock.

In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the TRA Participants may be accelerated or
significantly exceed any actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.

We expect that, in
certain circumstances, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments will be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits
that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.

Thus, under certain circumstances, we may be required to make payments significantly in advance of the
actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. We could also be required to make cash payments to the TRA Participants that are greater than the specified percentage of any actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax
benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or
preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We may need to incur
debt to finance payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.

We will not be reimbursed for any payments made to the TRA Participants under the Tax Receivable
Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.

Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting
positions that we determine, and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or another tax authority, may challenge all or part of the tax benefits we claim, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain such
challenge. The Tax Receivable Agreement may provide TRA Participants with certain rights in the event of such a challenge. The interests of the TRA Participants in any such challenge may differ from or conflict with our interests and your interests,
and the TRA Participants may exercise any rights they may have relating to any such challenge in a manner adverse to our interests and your interests. We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to the TRA Participants under the
Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made to a TRA Participants are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, we expect that
the Tax Receivable Agreement will provide that any excess cash payments made by us to a TRA Participant will be netted against any future cash payments we might otherwise be required to make to such TRA Participants. However, we might not determine
that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to a TRA Participant for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, if any of our tax reporting positions are challenged by a taxing authority, we anticipate that we will
not be permitted to reduce any future cash payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement until any such challenge is finally settled or determined. Moreover, the excess cash payments we made previously under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be
greater than the amount of future cash payments against which we would otherwise be permitted to net such excess. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules for determining applicable tax benefits we may claim are complex and factual in nature,
and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement significantly in excess of any actual cash tax savings that we realize
in respect of the tax attributes with respect to a TRA Participant that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement.

Unanticipated changes in
effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to taxes by the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or
adversely affected by a number of factors, including:





•




allocation of expenses to and among different jurisdictions;





•




changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;





•




expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;





•




tax effects of stock-based compensation;





•




costs related to intercompany restructurings;





•




changes in tax laws, tax treaties, regulations or interpretations thereof; or





•




lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than
anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.

In addition, we may be subject to audits of our
income, sales and other taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local and foreign taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If SOLV Energy Holdings LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and SOLV
Energy Holdings LLC might be subject to potentially significant tax inefficiencies.

We intend to operate such that SOLV Energy Holdings LLC does
not become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A “publicly traded partnership” is a partnership the

interests of which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Under certain circumstances, redemptions of
LLC Interests pursuant to the redemption right, or other transfers of LLC Interests, could cause SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to be treated as a publicly traded partnership. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide for certain safe harbors from
treatment as a publicly traded partnership. We intend to operate such that redemptions or other transfers of LLC Interests qualify for one or more such safe harbors or are otherwise restricted in a manner that is intended to prevent SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC from becoming a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If SOLV Energy Holdings LLC were
to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, significant tax inefficiencies might result for us and for SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, including as a result of the inability to file a consolidated
U.S. federal income tax return with SOLV Energy Holdings LLC.

If we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act, including as a result of our ownership of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Under Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be
deemed to be an “investment company” for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or
(ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets
(exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an “investment company,” as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.

We and SOLV Energy Holdings LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. As the sole managing member of SOLV
Energy Holdings LLC, we will control and operate SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC is not an “investment security” as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to
cease participation in the management of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, or if SOLV Energy Holdings LLC itself becomes an investment company, our interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC could be deemed an “investment security” for purposes of the
1940 Act.

We and SOLV Energy Holdings LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. If it were established
that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to monetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties and that
third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company. If we were required to register as an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940
Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

Our Sponsor has significant influence over us.

After giving effect to this offering and the Transactions, our Sponsor will beneficially own     % of our outstanding capital stock and
hold    % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock (or    % and    %, respectively, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our
Class A common stock in full). As long as our Sponsor owns or controls a significant percentage of our outstanding voting power, it will have the ability to significantly influence all corporate actions requiring

stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment to our organizational documents, or the approval of any merger or other
significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. Our Sponsor’s influence over our management could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential
acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Because our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain provisions that have the same effect as
Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) regulating certain business combinations with interested stockholders, but will provide that our Sponsor or its affiliates or transferees do not
constitute an interested stockholder, our Sponsor may transfer shares to a third party by transferring their common stock without the approval of our board of directors or other stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to
pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock.

Our Sponsor’s interests may not align with our interests as a company or the
interests of our other stockholders. For example, our Sponsor may have a different tax position from us (especially in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement), which could influence our Sponsor’s and our decisions regarding whether and when we
should dispose of assets, incur or refinance existing indebtedness, undergo certain changes of control, terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement or undertake actions that would result in the acceleration of any obligations thereunder. The structuring
of future transactions may take into account these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. Accordingly, our Sponsor could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which you would not approve or make
decisions with which you would disagree. Further, our Sponsor is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our Sponsor may also pursue acquisition
opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In recognition that principals, members, directors, managers, partners, stockholders, officers, employees and
other representatives of our Sponsor and its affiliates and investment funds may serve as our directors or officers, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that none of our Sponsor or any of our
directors who are employees of or affiliated with our Sponsor has any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business that we do. In the event that any of these persons or entities
acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for itself and us, we will not have any expectancy in such corporate opportunity, and these persons and entities will not have any duty to communicate or
offer such corporate opportunity to us and may pursue or acquire such corporate opportunity for themselves or direct such opportunity to another person. So long as our Sponsor continues to directly or indirectly own a significant amount of our
common stock, even if such amount is less than the majority thereof, our Sponsor will continue to be able to substantially influence or effectively control our ability to enter into corporate transactions. These potential conflicts of interest could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if, among other things, attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by our Sponsor to itself or its other affiliates.

Our management has not previously managed a public company in their current roles.

Certain of the individuals who now constitute our management have not previously managed a publicly traded company in their current roles. Compliance with
public company requirements will place significant additional demands on our management and will require us to enhance our investor relations, legal, financial and tax reporting, internal audit, legal, governance, investor relations and corporate
communications functions. These additional demands may strain our resources and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Following the offering, we will qualify as a

“
controlled company,
”
as defined in the





listing rules, and, as a result, we will
qualify

for
, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You may not have the same
protections
afforded to stockholders of companies that are
subject to such requirements. In addition, our Sponsor
’
s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders
.


After the closing of this offering, our Sponsor will continue to control 50% or more of the voting power for the election of directors.

As a result, we will qualify as a “controlled company” within the meaning of the      corporate governance standards. Under
the rules of     , a company of which more than 50% of the outstanding voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to
comply with certain      corporate governance requirements, including:





•




the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors;






•




the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent
directors ; and





•




the requirement that the compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors.


Following this offering, we may utilize these exemptions. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders
of companies that are subject to all of the stock exchange corporate governance requirements.

Delaware law and anti-takeover provisions in our
governing documents, as well as our existing and future debt agreements, could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current directors and may deprive our investors of the
opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware
law contain provisions that will have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing a third party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:





•




have terms that have the same effect as DGCL Section 203 but such provisions will not apply to our Sponsor,
its affiliates or its transferees;





•




provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;





•




authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock, the terms of which are established by our
board of directors without any need for action by stockholders, that could be used to implement a stockholder rights plan;





•




do not permit stockholders, other than the Sponsor as long as the Sponsor beneficially owns at least 50% of the
combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, to call special meetings of stockholders;





•




do not permit stockholders, other than the Sponsor as long as the Sponsor beneficially owns at least 50% of the
combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, to act by written consent; and





•




establish advance notice procedures, which apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election to our
board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.

Further, our credit
agreements impose, and we anticipate that documents governing our future indebtedness may impose, limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions. The occurrence of a change of control transaction could constitute an event of
default thereunder and permit acceleration of the indebtedness, thereby impeding our ability to enter into certain transactions.

The foregoing factors, as well as the significant common stock ownership by our Sponsor, could discourage,
delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, which could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some
investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock. See “Description of Capital Stock.”

We do not intend to pay any cash
distributions or dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future.

We do not currently intend to pay any dividends on our
Class A common stock, and our credit agreements limit our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock. We may also enter into other credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that restrict or limit our ability
to pay dividends on our Class A common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell our Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. See
“Dividend Policy.”

No market currently exists for our Class A common stock, and we cannot assure you that an active market will
develop for such stock.

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock. The initial public offering
price for our Class A common stock has been determined through negotiations among us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of the market price of our Class A common stock after this offering or to any other
established criteria of the value of our business. If you purchase shares of our Class A common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial public offering price. We cannot predict the extent to which investor
interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market on




or otherwise or how liquid that market might become. An active public market for our Class A common stock may
not develop or be sustained after this offering. If an active public market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of Class A common stock at a price that is attractive to you or at all.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of
the United States as the sole and exclusive forums for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or
our directors, officers or other employees.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject to certain
exceptions, unless we consent in writing in advance to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf,
(ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty or other wrongdoing by any current or former director, officer, employee, agent or stockholder to us or our stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any
provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (iv) action asserting a claim
governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware. Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), claims or causes of action arising thereunder must be brought in federal
district courts of the United States. The exclusive forum provision will provide that the provision will not apply to claims or causes of action arising under the Exchange Act.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the federal district
courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any action asserting a claim arising under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”) creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, accordingly we cannot be
certain that a court would enforce such a provision.

By agreeing to this provision, however, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or
our directors, officers, employees or other stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring an action
in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to assert the validity and enforceability of our exclusive forum provisions, which may require significant additional costs associated with
resolving such action in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find that the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to
satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.

Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our directors will not be
liable to us or any stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty, except (i) for acts that breach his or her duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, (iii) pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, which provides for liability of directors for unlawful payments of dividends of unlawful stock purchase, or (iv) for any transaction
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. Our amended and restated bylaws will also require us, if so requested, to advance expenses that such director or officer incurred in defending or investigating a threatened or pending
action, suit or proceeding, provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us. Any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our
available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.

We have identified material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could result in us failing to detect material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements. If our remediation of the material weaknesses is not effective, or if we
otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact the market
value of our Class A common stock.

During the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
prospectus, our control environment did not meet the standards required for financial reporting as a public company. Since the conclusion of our transition services agreements with our former parent, Swinerton, in 2022, we have been developing our
financial reporting processes and hiring personnel. However, during this time, we lacked the formalized business processes and internal controls necessary to ensure reliable financial reporting. These deficiencies contributed to material weaknesses
in internal controls over financial reporting which were identified in connection with the audit of such consolidated financial statements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial
reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses that we identified included the following:





•




We did not design and implement appropriate controls, policies or procedures over the
procure-to-pay
process, including the recognition of liabilities incurred and prepayments at
period-end.
We also lacked appropriate
controls around the vendor
set-up
process and approvals of transactions entered into with vendors.



56





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.





•




We did not design and operate effective controls over percentage of completion (POC) revenue recognition,
including controls over timely and accurate revenue
cut-off,
estimates to complete and transaction price. Further, we did not have sufficient personnel with an appropriate level of technical accounting
knowledge to review our revenue recognition conclusions.





•




We did not design or operate effective controls over the review of third-party analyses to determine fair value
for purposes of goodwill impairment assessments and equity award valuations, including review of significant assumptions and valuation methodologies.





•




We did not design or operate IT general controls related to user access, change management, segregation of
duties, and system operations within all IT systems and applications deemed relevant to our financial reporting.

We are actively
working to remediate these material weaknesses described above and establishing a robust internal control environment that is appropriate for a public company. Our remediation measures include: (i) enhancing our control environment, including
updating accounting policies, procedures, and financial reporting controls; (ii) hiring additional executives in key finance leadership positions with public company experience, as well as other key operational functions;
(iii) establishing consistent transaction-level controls across key processes such as
procure-to-pay,

order-to-cash,
and goodwill and impairment; and (iv) implementing IT general controls to support the integrity and reliability of financial reporting systems.

While we are committed to completing these remediation efforts as quickly as possible and investing in the personnel, processes and systems necessary to
maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, these efforts are ongoing and will require validation and testing of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over a sustained period of financial reporting cycles.
We cannot be certain that these measures will successfully remediate the material weaknesses or that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not be discovered in the future. If the steps we take do not correct the material weaknesses
in a timely manner, we will be unable to conclude that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. We also cannot assure you that there will not be any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting in the future.

Upon becoming a public company, we will be required to comply the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley
Act”), which will require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with
our second annual report after this offering. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at that time. To achieve compliance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act within the prescribed period, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and continue to execute on a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of our internal control over
financial reporting, continue taking steps to improve control processes, as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over
financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

We may not be able to remediate any material weaknesses prior to the deadline imposed by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for management’s
assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
the event that we are not able to successfully remediate the existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or identify additional material weaknesses, or if our internal control over financial reporting is perceived
as inadequate or it is perceived that we are unable to produce timely or accurate consolidated financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our results of operations, the price of our Class A common stock could decline, we could

subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our Class A common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory agencies, which could require additional financial and management
resources, or our Class A common stock may not be able to remain listed on such exchange.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish
research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market
for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry
analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of these analysts
cease coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if our results of operations do not meet
the expectations of the investor community, or one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock, our stock price could decline. As a result, you may not be able to sell shares of our Class A common stock at prices equal to
or greater than the initial public offering price.

Becoming a public company will increase our compliance costs significantly and require the
expansion and enhancement of a variety of financial and management control systems and infrastructure and the hiring of significant additional qualified personnel.

Prior to this offering, we have not been subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) or the other rules and regulations of the SEC, or any securities exchange relating to public companies. We are working with our legal, independent accounting and financial advisors
to identify those areas in which changes should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and our obligations as a public company. These areas include financial planning and analysis, tax, corporate governance,
accounting policies and procedures, internal controls, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, significant changes in these and other areas and have
begun incurring expenses in preparation for becoming a public company. The expenses that will be required in order to adequately prepare for being, and those required to operate as, a public company could be material. Compliance with the various
reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies will also require considerable time and attention of management and will also require us to successfully hire and integrate a significant number of additional qualified personnel into
our existing finance, legal, human resources and operations departments.

The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources,
divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and officers, which may divert from our business operations.

As a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of      and other
applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems,
resources and employees. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting. To maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a
result, management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have already hired additional employees in
preparation for these heightened requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future, which would increase our costs and expenses.

We also expect that being a public company will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer
liability insurance, and we may have to choose between reduced coverage and substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board
of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee.

Future sales and issuances of our Class A common stock
or rights to purchase our Class A common stock (or other equity securities or securities convertible into our Class A common stock), including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, or the perception that future sales by us, our Sponsor
or our other existing stockholders in the public market following this offering could cause dilution of the percentage of ownership of our stockholders, could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.

After this offering, the sale of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the
prevailing market price of shares of our Class A common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem
appropriate.

Upon consummation of the Transactions, we will have outstanding a total of




shares
of Class A common stock (or




shares if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares). Of the outstanding shares, the





shares sold in this offering (or




shares if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares) will be freely
tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, other than any shares held by our affiliates. Any shares of Class A common stock held by our affiliates will be eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, subject to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144.

Our directors, executive officers and
substantially all of our stockholders have entered into
lock-up
agreements with the underwriters prior to the commencement of this offering that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict the sale of the shares
of our Class A common stock and certain other securities held by them for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus. Upon the expiration of the
lock-up
agreements, shares held by our
directors, executive officers and certain other stockholders will be eligible for resale in the public market subject, in the case of shares held by our affiliates, to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of
Rule 144.









may, in their sole discretion and at any time without notice, release all or any portion of the shares or
securities subject to any such
lock-up
agreements. See “Underwriting” and “Shares Eligible for Future Sale” for a description of these
lock-up

agreements.

In addition, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined herein), after the completion of this offering, our Sponsor will have
certain registration rights, including the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the offer and sale of its shares of our Class A common stock under the Securities Act (including shares of Class A common stock
issuable upon exchange of LLC Interests). Following the completion of this offering, the shares of Class A common stock covered by registration rights will represent approximately

% of our outstanding Class A common stock.
Registration of any of these outstanding shares of Class A common stock or shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of LLC Interests would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon
effectiveness of the registration statement. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” and “Shares Eligible for Future Sale” for a description of these registration rights.

Exercise of such registration rights and any subsequent sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock by our Sponsor could cause the
prevailing market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Subject to the
lock-up
agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and applicable law, our Sponsor will determine the timing and amount of
such sales, and such sales could be executed by our Sponsor at a time or times that otherwise may not align with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders.

In connection with this offering, we intend to file a registration statement with the SEC on Form
S-8
providing for
the registration of shares of our Class A common stock issued or reserved for issuance under new and existing

equity plans. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions and the expiration of
lock-up
agreements, shares issued pursuant to or registered under the
registration statement on Form
S-8
will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.

In the future, we may also issue securities in connection with investments, acquisitions or capital raising activities. In particular, the number of shares of
our Class A common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition, or to raise additional equity capital, could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our Class A common stock. Any such issuance of
additional securities in the future may result in additional dilution to you, or may adversely impact the price of our Class A common stock.

We cannot assure you that our stock price will not decline or will not be subject to significant volatility after this offering.

Shares of our Class A common stock sold in this offering may experience significant volatility on





. An active, liquid and orderly market for our Class A common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our Class A common stock or cause it to be highly
volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future and you could lose all or part of your investment. Some of the factors that could negatively affect
our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock include:





•




variations in our quarterly or annual results of operations;





•




changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual results of operations and those
expected by investors and analysts;





•




the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to
cover our Class A common stock;





•




additions or departures of key management personnel;





•




any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;





•




announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;





•




actions by institutional stockholders;





•




litigation and governmental investigations;





•




legislative or regulatory changes;





•




judicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;





•




changes in government programs;





•




changes in market valuations of similar companies;





•




speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;






•




announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic
relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;





•




the market response to rights granted to our Sponsor pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation; and





•




general market, political and economic conditions, including local conditions in the markets in which we operate.


These broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual
financial performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including recently. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the
market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often

been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If you purchase shares of our Class A common
stock sold in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution.

If you purchase Class A common stock in this offering, you
will pay more for your shares than the amounts paid by existing stockholders for their shares. As a result, you will incur immediate dilution of $




per share, representing the difference between
the assumed initial public offering price of $




per share (the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) and our pro forma net
tangible book value (deficit) per share after giving effect to this offering. See “Dilution.”

OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

SOLV Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on April 1, 2025 and is the issuer of the Class A common stock offered by this prospectus.
Prior to this offering and the Transactions (as defined below), all of our business operations have been conducted through SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and the Original Equity Owners are the only owners of SOLV
Energy Holdings LLC. We will consummate the Transactions, excluding this offering, substantially concurrently with or prior to the consummation of this offering.

Existing Organizational Structure

For U.S. federal
income tax purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC was historically an entity disregarded as separate from SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP, an entity taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a disregarded entity, SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC was not subject to U.S. federal income tax. In connection with the Transactions, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will become a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, either prior to or as a result of the acquisition of LLC Interests
in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC by SOLV Energy, Inc. As a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, and we will incur income taxes on our allocable share of any
net taxable income of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC at the prevailing corporate tax rates.

Transactions

Prior to the Transactions, SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP will be the sole holder of common stock of SOLV Energy, Inc. We will consummate the following
organizational transactions in connection with this offering:

we will amend and restate the existing limited liability company agreement of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, which
will become effective substantially concurrently with or prior to the consummation of this offering, to, among other things, (i) recapitalize all existing ownership interests in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC into LLC Interests and (ii) issue a
non-economic
member interest and appoint SOLV Energy, Inc. as the sole managing member of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC upon its acquisition of LLC Interests in connection with this offering;





•




we will amend and restate SOLV Energy, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation to, among other things, provide
(i) for Class A common stock, with each share of our Class A common stock entitling its holder to one vote per share on all matters presented to our stockholders generally and (ii) for Class B common stock, with each share
of our Class B common stock entitling its holder to one vote per share on all matters presented to our stockholders generally, and that shares of our Class B common stock may only be held by the Continuing Equity Owners and their
respective permitted transferees as described in “Description of Capital Stock—Common Stock—Class B common stock;”





•




we will issue




shares of our Class B common stock to
the Continuing Equity Owners, which is equal to the number of LLC Interests held by such Continuing Equity Owners, for nominal consideration;





•




we will issue




shares of our Class A common stock to
the purchasers in this offering (or




shares if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) in exchange for net proceeds of
approximately $


million (or approximately $


million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock)
based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $

•




SOLV Energy, Inc. will enter into the Tax Receivable Agreement with SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and each of the TRA
Participants. The terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement will be described in a subsequent filing. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

directly through American Securities’ ownership of LLC Interests and indirectly through SOLV Energy, Inc.’s ownership of LLC Interests, approximately  % of the economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC (or approximately  %
of the economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) and (iii)




shares of
Class B common stock of SOLV Energy, Inc., representing approximately  % (and, together with the shares of Class A common stock,
%) of the combined voting power of all of SOLV Energy, Inc.’s
common stock (or




shares of Class B common stock of SOLV Energy, Inc., representing approximately  % (and, together with the





shares of Class A common stock,

%) if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock);





•




the Continuing Equity Owners (excluding American Securities) will collectively own (i)





LLC Interests of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, representing approximately

LLC Interests, representing approximately  % of the economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of

all of SOLV Energy Inc.’s common stock (or

•




the purchasers in this offering will own (i)

approximately  % of the economic interest if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock), and (ii) through SOLV Energy,
Inc.’s ownership of LLC Interests, indirectly will hold approximately  % of the economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC (or approximately  % of the economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock).

A diagram depicting our organizational structure after
giving effect to the Transactions, including this offering, assuming no exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, will be provided in a subsequent filing. Our post-offering
organizational structure, as described above, is commonly referred to as an umbrella
partnership-C-corporation
(or
UP-C)

structure. This organizational structure will allow our Continuing Equity Owners to retain their equity ownership in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of LLC
interests. Investors in this offering will, by contrast, hold their equity ownership in SOLV Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the form of shares of Class A common stock


As the sole managing member of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, we will operate and control all of the business and affairs of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and,
through SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, conduct our business. Following the Transactions, including this offering, SOLV Energy, Inc. will have a minority economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, but will
control the management of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC as its sole managing member. As a result, SOLV Energy, Inc. will consolidate SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and record a significant
non-controlling
interest in a
consolidated entity in SOLV Energy, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements for the economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners.

Unless otherwise indicated, this prospectus assumes the shares of Class A common stock are offered at $


per
share (the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus). The initial public offering price will impact the relative allocation of LLC Interests issued in the Transactions among the Original Equity Owners and,
in turn, the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock issued to the Original Equity Owners in the Transactions. Additionally, while the number of shares of Class A common stock being offered hereby to the public will
not change, any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Class A common stock sold by SOLV Energy, Inc. in this offering due to a change in the initial public offering price will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the
number of LLC Interests purchased by SOLV Energy, Inc. directly from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC at a price per unit equal to the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in this offering. Therefore, the indirect economic
interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC represented by the shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be largely unaffected by the initial public offering price. See “Use of Proceeds.”

Incorporation of SOLV Energy, Inc.

SOLV Energy, Inc.,
the issuer of the Class A common stock offered by this prospectus, was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 1, 2025. SOLV Energy, Inc. has not engaged in any material business or other activities except in connection with its
formation and the Transactions. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of SOLV Energy, Inc. that will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of this offering will, among other things, authorize two classes of common
stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock, each having the terms described in “Description of Capital Stock.”

Reclassification and Amendment and Restatement of the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement

Prior to or substantially concurrently with the consummation of this offering, the existing limited liability company agreement of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC
will be amended and restated to, among other things, recapitalize its capital structure by creating a single new class of common units that we refer to as “LLC

Interests” and provide for a right of redemption of common units in exchange for, at our election, shares of our Class A common stock or cash. See “Certain Relationships and
Related Party Transactions—SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreements.”

Tax Receivable Agreement

Prior to the completion of this offering, we will enter into a tax receivable agreement with certain of our Continuing Equity Owners that provides for cash
payments to the TRA Participants equal to a percentage of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of certain circumstances (calculated using certain assumptions). We will be
required to make payments to the TRA Participants under the Tax Receivable Agreement even if all of the Continuing Equity Owners exchange or redeem their remaining LLC Interests, and the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be
conditioned upon continued ownership of our stock by the exchanging Continuing Equity Owners. The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are obligations of SOLV Energy, Inc. and not of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. We expect that the
amount of the cash payments we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. The terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement will be described in a subsequent filing.

USE OF PROCEEDS

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from our sale of





shares of Class A common stock
in this offering will be approximately $


, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us in connection with this offering. The underwriters also have an option to
purchase up to an additional




shares of Class A common stock from us. We estimate that the net proceeds to us, if the underwriters exercise their right to purchase the maximum of






additional shares of Class A common stock from us, will be approximately $


, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated expenses payable by us in connection with this offering. This assumes a public offering price of $


per share of Class A common stock, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover
of this prospectus.

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering (including from any exercise by the underwriters of their option
to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) to purchase





LLC Interests from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC at a price per LLC Interest equal to the initial public offering
price of our Class A common stock, less the underwriting discounts and commissions.

We intend to cause SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to use the net
proceeds it receives from us in connection with this offering for general corporate purposes, which could include the repayment of certain indebtedness, and growth initiatives, including potential merger and acquisition opportunities. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, we will use the additional net proceeds to purchase LLC Interests from certain Original Equity Owners and/or to purchase additional LLC Interests from
SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to maintain the
one-to-one
ratio between the number of shares of Class A common stock issued by us and the number of LLC Interests owned by
us.

Assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, a $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public
offering price of $


per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by
$


, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us.

DIVIDEND POLICY

We do not currently intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. However, in the future, subject to the factors
described below and our future liquidity and capitalization, we may change this policy and choose to pay dividends. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results
of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable laws and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

Our ability to pay dividends is currently restricted by our Credit Facilities and may be further restricted by any future indebtedness we incur.

We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own and has no material assets other than its ownership of LLC Interests. As a
result, our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock, if our board of directors determines to do so, will be dependent upon the ability of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to pay cash dividends and distributions to us. SOLV Energy Holdings
LLC’s ability to pay cash dividends and distributions to us is currently restricted by the terms of our Credit Facilities and may be further restricted by any future indebtedness we may incur. See “Description of Material
Indebtedness.”

If SOLV Energy Holdings LLC makes such distributions, the holders of LLC Interests will be entitled to receive equivalent
distributions from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. However, because we must pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and pay our expenses, amounts ultimately distributed as dividends to holders of our Class A common stock are
expected to be less than the amounts distributed by SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to the other holders of LLC Interests on a per share basis. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

Under the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will generally be required from time to time to make pro rata distributions in cash to
us and the other holders of LLC Interests at certain assumed tax rates in amounts that are sufficient to cover the income taxes payable on our and the other LLC Interest holders’ respective allocable shares of the taxable income of SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC. We may receive tax distributions significantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time
to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, funding repurchases of Class A common stock; acquiring additional newly issued LLC Interests from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC at a per
unit price determined by reference to the market value of the Class A common stock; paying dividends, which may include special dividends, on its Class A common stock; or any combination of the foregoing. We will have no obligation to
distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders. We also expect, if necessary, to undertake ameliorative actions, which may include pro rata or
non-pro
rata
reclassifications, combinations, subdivisions or adjustments of outstanding LLC Interests, to maintain a
one-to-one
ratio between LLC Interests and shares of
Class A common stock. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure—Our principal asset after the completion of this offering will be our direct or indirect interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and, as a result,
we will depend on distributions from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to pay our taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various
limitations and restrictions.”

DILUTION

If you invest in our Class A common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be immediately diluted to the extent of the difference between
the initial public offering price per share of our Class A common stock and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A common stock upon the consummation of this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the per
share offering price of our Class A common stock is in excess of the pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to the Class A common stock held by the existing equity holders.

The Continuing Equity Owners will maintain their LLC Interests after the Transactions, but will be able to cause the exchange of their LLC Interests for
shares of Class A common stock. We have presented dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share assuming that all of the holders of LLC Interests (other than the Company) had their LLC Interests exchanged for newly issued shares of
Class A common stock on a
one-for-one
basis and the cancellation for no consideration of all of their shares of Class B common stock (which are not entitled to
receive distributions or dividends from the Company) in order to more meaningfully present the dilutive impact on the investors in this offering.

Our pro
forma net tangible book value as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $


, or $


per share of Class A common stock on a fully diluted basis. Pro forma net
tangible book value represents the amount of total tangible assets less total liabilities, and pro forma net tangible book value per share represents pro forma net tangible book value divided by the number of shares of Class A common stock
outstanding after giving effect to the Transactions and assuming that all of the holders of LLC Interests (other than the Company) exchanged their LLC Interests for newly issued shares of Class A common stock on a

one-for-one
basis.

After giving effect to (i) the Transactions,
assuming that all of the holders of LLC Interests (other than the Company) exchanged their LLC Interests for newly issued shares of Class A common stock on a

one-for-one
basis, (ii) the sale of




shares of Class A common stock in this offering at the assumed
initial public offering price of $


per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) and (iii) the application of the net proceeds from this offering as described in
“Use of Proceeds,” our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of December 31, 2024 would have been $


, or $


per share of Class A common stock. This amount
represents an immediate increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of $


per share of Class A common stock to our existing equity holders and an immediate dilution in pro forma as adjusted net
tangible book value of $


per share of Class A common stock to new investors in this offering.

The following table
illustrates this dilution on a per share of Class A common stock basis given the assumptions above:




Assumed initial public offering price per share

Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of

Class A common stock purchased from us, the total cash consideration paid to us, or to be paid, and the average price per share paid, or to be paid, by existing equity holders and by new investors purchasing shares in this offering, at an
assumed initial public offering price of $

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $

million and, in the
case of an increase, would increase the percentage of total consideration paid by new investors by




percentage points and, in the case of a decrease, would decrease the percentage of total
consideration paid by new investors by




percentage points, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and before
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us in connection with this offering. An increase (decrease) of shares in the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of
this prospectus, would increase (decrease) the total consideration paid by new investors by $


million and, in the case of an increase, would increase the percentage of total consideration paid by new investors by





percentage points and, in the case of a decrease, would decrease the percentage of total consideration paid by new investors by





percentage points, assuming no change in the assumed initial public offering price per share and before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us in connection with this offering.

If the underwriters were to fully exercise their option to purchase





additional shares of our
Class A common stock, the percentage of shares of our Class A common stock held by existing equity holders would be

%, and the percentage of shares of our Class A common stock held by new investors
would be

%. In addition, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase addition shares of our Class A common stock in full, a $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$



per share would increase (decrease) our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value by $


, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this
offering by $


and the dilution per share to new investors by $


, in each after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The above discussion and tables are based on the number of shares outstanding at




,





. In addition, we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating
plans. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in further dilution to our stockholders.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION


The following unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 gives effect to the pro forma
adjustments related to the organizational transactions, tax receivable agreement and this offering, which we refer to as the “Transactions Adjustments.” The unaudited pro forma consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2024 gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2024. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information as of December 31, 2024 gives effect to the pro forma adjustments as if they
had occurred on December 31, 2024. See “Capitalization.” The unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared by our management and is based on SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s historical financial statements and the
assumptions and adjustments described in the notes to the unaudited pro forma financial information below. The presentation of the unaudited pro forma financial information is prepared in conformity with Article 11 of

Regulation S-X rules
effective January 1, 2021.

Our historical financial information as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2024 has been derived from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

We based the pro forma adjustments on available information and on assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances in order to reflect, on
a pro forma basis, the impact of the relevant transactions on the historical financial information of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. See the notes to unaudited pro forma financial information below for a discussion of assumptions made. The unaudited pro
forma financial information does not purport to be indicative of our results of operations or financial position had the relevant transactions occurred on the dates assumed and does not project our results of operations or financial position for any
future period or date.

The pro forma adjustments related to the Transactions, which we refer to as the “Transactions Adjustments” are described
in the notes to the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information and primarily include:





•




adjustments for the Transactions, the entry into the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement and the entry into one or
more Tax Receivable Agreements;





•




the recognition of a
non-controlling interest
in SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners, which will be exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock on
a one-for-one basis
in accordance
with the terms of the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement;





•




provision for federal and state income taxes of SOLV Energy, Inc. as a taxable corporation at an effective rate
of  % for the year ended December 31, 2024 (calculated using a U.S. federal income tax rate of 21%);





•




the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock to the purchasers in this offering in exchange for net
proceeds of approximately $  , assuming that the shares are offered at $  per share (the midpoint of the price range listed on the cover page of this prospectus), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions but
before offering expenses;





•




the application by SOLV Energy, Inc. of the net proceeds from this offering to acquire newly issued LLC Interests
from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC at a purchase price per LLC Interests equal to the initial public offering price of Class A common stock net of underwriting discounts and commissions; and





•




the application by SOLV Energy Holdings LLC of a portion of the proceeds of the sale of LLC Interests to SOLV
Energy, Inc. to (i) pay fees and expenses of approximately $  in connection with this offering and (ii) as otherwise set forth in “Use of Proceeds.”

We are in the process of implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public
companies. We expect to incur additional annual expenses

related to these procedures and processes and, among other things, additional directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements of the SEC, transfer
agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal, and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal expenses, and other related costs. Due to the scope and complexity of these activities, the amount of these costs could increase or decrease
materially and are based on subjective estimates and assumptions that cannot be factually supported. We have not included any pro forma adjustments related to these costs.

Because SOLV Energy, Inc. was formed on April 1, 2025 and will have no material assets or results of operations until the completion of the IPO, its
historical financial information is not included in the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is provided for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results that would have occurred if the Transactions had been completed as of the dates set forth above, nor is it indicative of our future results. Additionally, the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information does not give effect to the
potential impact of any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies, or cost savings that may result from the Transactions or any integration costs that will not have a continuing impact.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information should be read together with “Our Organizational Structure,” “Capitalization,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our historical financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information (Year Ended December 31, 2024)




(1)


Following the Transactions, SOLV Energy, Inc., will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to
state and local taxes. As a result, the pro forma statement of operations reflects an adjustment to income tax expense for corporate income taxes to reflect a statutory tax rate of %, which includes a provision for U.S. federal income taxes
and assumes the highest statutory rates apportioned to each state and local jurisdiction. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC was historically an entity disregarded as separate from SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP, an
entity taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In connection with the Transactions, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will become a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, either prior to or as a result of the acquisition of
LLC Interests in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC by SOLV Energy, Inc. and, as a result, its members, including SOLV Energy, Inc., will pay income taxes with respect to their allocable shares of its taxable income.

The pro forma adjustment for income tax expense represents tax expense on income that will be taxable in jurisdictions after our corporate
reorganization that previously had not been taxable. The adjustment is calculated as pro forma income before income taxes multiplied by the ownership percentage of the controlling interest and multiplied by the effective tax rate of  %.

In connection with the Transactions, we will be appointed as the sole managing member of SOLV Energy Holdings
LLC pursuant to the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement. As a result, while we will own less than 100% of the economic interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, we will have 100% of the voting power and control the management of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC.
Because we will manage and operate the business and control the strategic decisions and
day-to-day
operations of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and will also have a
substantial financial interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, we will consolidate the financial results of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, and a portion of our net income (loss) will be allocated to noncontrolling interests to reflect the entitlement of the
Continuing Equity Owners to a portion of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC net income (loss). We will initially hold approximately

% of the outstanding LLC Interests (or approximately

% if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full), and the remaining LLC Interests will be held by the Continuing Equity Owners. Immediately following the Transactions, the ownership percentage held by the noncontrolling
interests will be approximately

%. Net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests will represent approximately

% of net loss.

Pro forma basic net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing the pro forma net loss
available to Class A common stockholders by the pro forma weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Pro forma diluted net loss per share of Class A common stock is computed by adjusting the pro
forma net loss available to Class A common stockholders and the pro forma weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding to give effect to potentially dilutive securities.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet (as of December 31, 2024)



(1)


We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $  , after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $  , based on an assumed initial public offering price of $  per share (the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range set forth on the cover page of
this prospectus) and assuming the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock is not exercised. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in full, we
expect to receive approximately $  of net proceeds based on an assumed initial public offering price of $  per share (the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus).

We estimate that the offering expenses (other than the underwriting discount and commissions) will be
approximately $  . All of such offering expenses will be paid for or otherwise borne by SOLV Energy Holdings LLC.

We will use
all of the net proceeds from this offering (including net proceeds received if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full) to (i) acquire newly issued LLC Interests from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC
and (ii) acquire LLC Interests from Original Equity Owners at a purchase price per LLC Interest equal to the initial public offering price of Class A common stock, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions, collectively
representing % of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC outstanding LLC Interests (or %, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full).

SOLV Energy Holdings LLC currently intends to use the proceeds from the issuance of LLC Interests to SOLV Energy. Inc. to (i) pay fees and
expenses of approximately $  in connection with this offering and (ii) as otherwise set forth in “Use of Proceeds.” See “Use of Proceeds.”



(2)


We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and will file income tax returns for U.S. federal
and certain state and local jurisdictions. This adjustment reflects the recognition of deferred taxes in connection with the Transaction assuming the federal rates currently in effect and the highest statutory rates apportioned to each state and
local jurisdiction. We have recorded a pro forma deferred tax asset adjustment of $  (or $  if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock). The deferred tax asset
includes (i) $  related to temporary differences in the book basis as compared to the tax basis of our investment in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, and (ii) $  related to tax benefits from future deductions attributable to
payments under the Tax Receivable Agreements as described further in Note (4) below. To the extent we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, we will record an
appropriate valuation allowance based on an analysis of the objective or subjective negative evidence.



(3)


We are deferring certain costs associated with this offering. These costs primarily represent legal, accounting
and other direct costs and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Upon completion of this offering, these deferred costs will be charged against the proceeds from this offering with a corresponding reduction to additional
paid-in
capital.



(4)


Reflects the recognition of a liability of $  (or $  if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock), which represents % of the full obligation for applicable deferred tax assets under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreements that we will enter into upon
completion of this offering. Upon the completion of this offering, we will be a party to one or more Tax Receivable Agreements with the TRA Participants. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to make cash payments to the TRA
Participants equal to a percentage of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of certain circumstances (calculated using certain assumptions). Our obligations under the Tax
Receivable Agreements will also apply with respect to any person who is issued LLC Interests in the future and who becomes a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement. See “Our Organizational Structure” and “Certain Relationships and
Related Party Transactions.” The terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement will be

LLC Interests for shares of our Class A common stock nor for certain future payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement.



(5)


Upon completion of the Transaction, this offering and the application of the net proceeds from this offering,
we will be appointed as the sole managing member of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and will hold     LLC Interests, constituting

(or     LLC Units, constituting % of the outstanding economic interests in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in full). See

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of, and for, the
periods presented. This discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together
with the sections entitled “About This Prospectus—Presentation of Financial Results,” “Prospectus Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial and Other Data,” “Risk Factors,”
“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements,
including statements regarding industry outlook, our expectations for the future of our business and our liquidity and capital resources as well as other
non-historical
statements. These statements are based
on current expectations and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Our
actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements.

Overview

We are a leading provider of infrastructure services to the power industry, including engineering, procurement, construction, testing, commissioning,
operations, maintenance and repowering. We specialize in designing, building and maintaining utility-scale solar and battery storage projects and related T&D infrastructure. Our customers include project developers, independent power producers
and utilities. Our new construction projects are typically executed over 12 to 18 months pursuant to LNTP agreements followed by a
lump-sum
EPC contract. We provide O&M services pursuant to long-term
contracts that typically obligate the customer to pay us a fixed fee for operations and routine preventative maintenance and additional fees for corrective maintenance on a time and materials basis.

On October 7, 2024, we merged with ASPE, the parent company of CS Energy. The CS Merger was considered a merger between entities under common control.
Due to the common control ownership of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and CS Energy since 2021, the historical financial information of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC was recasted similar to the pooling of interest method and retrospectively adjusted for all
periods presented to reflect the combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flow of both entities as if the merger had occurred at the earliest period presented, January 1, 2022.

On January 8, 2025, we acquired 100% of the ownership interests in Sacramento Drilling, Inc., a solar predrill and pile foundation installation
contractor based in Sacramento, California. The aggregate consideration for the acquisition was approximately $19.5 million, of which approximately $14.0 million was paid in cash at closing, and $5.5 million is deferred and payable on
the
one-year
anniversary of the acquisition.

On June 13, 2025, we acquired 100% of the ownership
interests in Spartan Infrastructure, Inc., a provider of T&D infrastructure services. The aggregate cash consideration for the acquisition was approximately $45.0 million, which excludes working capital adjustments and does not include
future consideration that may be payable upon the achievement of certain specified performance objectives.

Backlog

For
infrastructure services providers, backlog can be an indicator of future revenue. Different companies define and calculate backlog in different manners. We have two measures of backlog: (1) Next 12 Months Backlog, which includes
Signed Backlog and Awarded Backlog (each as defined below) and Estimated Corrective Maintenance Backlog (as defined below) that we anticipate will be recognized as revenue over the next twelve



84





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



months, and (2) Total Backlog, which includes all Signed Backlog and Awarded Backlog, and Estimated Corrective Maintenance Backlog. Our backlog includes the following categories of
projects:

Signed Backlog:
Represents the anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts where scope is adequately
defined. Signed Backlog includes the value of EPC contracts, LNTP agreements and the minimum amounts over the remaining term of O&M agreements that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The remaining value of EPC contracts can increase
or decrease based on change orders that are mutually agreed between us and the customer during the construction process. We do not consider renewals or the impact of early terminations when estimating our backlog from O&M agreements.

Awarded Backlog:
Represents the anticipated revenue from contracts where the customer has agreed upon the price for the job and signed an LNTP
agreement in anticipation of entering into an EPC contract with us, but has not yet executed such contract. When a customer has an existing executed LNTP agreement with us, we include that value in Signed Backlog. Awarded Backlog only includes
the remaining expected value of the EPC contract.

Estimated Corrective Maintenance Backlog:
Represents the estimated revenue from corrective
maintenance work on sites where we have an existing O&M agreement over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the terms of our O&M agreements, we provide preventative maintenance services pursuant to a fixed fee and corrective
maintenance on a time and materials basis. Based on our experience, the amount of corrective maintenance a solar or battery storage project will require in any given year is estimable and has historically ranged from between 80% and 90% of the
amount we charge for preventative maintenance. We estimate Estimated Corrective Maintenance Backlog by multiplying the average annual revenues we have generated from corrective maintenance, expressed as a percentage of the fixed preventative
maintenance revenues we generated in the same periods since 2022 (the “CM Ratio”) by the total amount of remaining minimum preventative maintenance fees we are due pursuant to O&M agreements. As of December 31, 2024, the CM
Ratio was 82%, or $0.82 of corrective maintenance revenue per $1.00 of preventative maintenance.

Backlog should not be considered a comprehensive
indicator of future revenue, as a percentage of our revenue is derived from change orders and other revenues that are not included in our backlog. Additionally, any of our contracts may be terminated by our customers on relatively short
notice. In the event of a project cancellation, we are typically reimbursed for all of our negotiated costs through a specific date, as well as all reasonable costs associated with demobilizing from the jobsite, but typically we have no
contractual right to the total revenue reflected in Awarded Backlog. Projects can also remain in backlog for extended periods of time as a result of customer delays, permitting or regulatory delays, equipment delays or project specific
issues. We do not include future revenue from projects where scope, and therefore value, is not adequately defined in our backlog. For more information on backlog, please see the “Key Performance Indicators”

Components of our Results of Operations

The following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations.

Revenue

We provide EPC services to our customers
primarily under lump sum contracts and O&M services pursuant to long-term contracts that typically obligate the customer to pay us a fixed fee for operations and routine preventative maintenance and additional fees for corrective maintenance on
a time and materials basis. We recognize revenue from EPC services using the percentage of completion method, which is generally measured as the percentage of costs incurred in the period to total estimated costs. The percentage of completion is
then multiplied by estimated total contract values to determine revenue in the period. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 96.0% of our revenues recognized were associated with this revenue recognition method.

Our actual revenues from EPC services can vary, sometimes substantially, from previous estimates due to changes in a variety of factors, including unforeseen
or changed circumstances not included in management’s cost estimates or covered by the contracts. Changes in cost estimates on certain contracts may result in the issuance of change orders, which can be approved or unapproved by the customer,
or the assertion of contract claims. Management determines the probability that costs associated with change orders and claims will be recovered based on, among other things, contractual entitlement, past practices with the customer and specific
discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer.

We recognize revenue from O&M services in two different ways. For standard O&M service
contracts with specified service periods, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period. For other O&M service contracts that are based on time and materials rates, such as repair, replacement, and refurbishment
services, revenue is recognized using an output method.

Change orders are a type of variable consideration that are generally not distinct from the
existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract. Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an
assessment of the anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available. We recognize revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur
or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

Cost of revenue and Gross profit

Cost of revenue consist primarily of labor costs, costs for subcontractors, equipment rentals, materials and supplies, insurance, depreciation of property and
equipment and software. Gross profit represents revenue less cost of revenue. Gross profit will generally be lower if actual costs to complete a contract exceed our contract costs estimated as we are unable to pass the increased cost to our
customers. Estimated losses on contracts, or the excess of the total estimated costs to complete a contract over the contract’s total estimated contract price, are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined. Factors impacting
our cost of revenue and gross profit are described in the “—Key Factors Affecting Our Performance” section below.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative salaries and benefits,
non-cash
stock compensation and related benefits for management, certain other employee expenses, including travel and training, marketing, office rent and utilities, professional fees, expenses associated with
information technology used in administration of the business, and depreciation of property and equipment and software. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of becoming a public company.

Interest expense

Interest expense consists of interest expense on outstanding debt obligations, finance leases and amortization of deferred financing costs.

Interest income

Interest income consists of interest
earned on cash, customer late payments, and other investments.

Other income, net

Other income, net consists of fair value gains and losses on our investments, changes in fair value of derivative instruments, and gain and losses on disposed
long-term assets.

Noncontrolling interest

In
connection with the Transactions, we will be appointed as the sole managing member of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC pursuant to the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement. Because we will manage and operate the business and control the strategic decisions
and day-to-day operations
of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and will also have a substantial financial interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, we will consolidate the
financial results of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, and a portion of our net income (loss) will be allocated to the noncontrolling interest to reflect the entitlement of the Continuing Equity Owners to a portion of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s
net income (loss). We will hold approximately

% of the LLC Interests (or approximately

% if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in full),
and the remaining LLC Interests will be held by the Continuing Equity Owners.

Income tax expense

Our business was historically operated through SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, a limited liability company. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC is currently treated as an entity disregarded as separate from SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership that is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a disregarded entity, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC
is not subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, historical income tax expense reflects certain state and local taxes.

In connection with the
Transactions, SOLV Energy, Inc. will acquire LLC Interests in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (either before or as a result of the acquisition of LLC
Interests in such entity by SOLV Energy, Inc.). As a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. As a result of its ownership of LLC Interests, SOLV Energy,
Inc., which is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and will be taxed at the
prevailing corporate tax rates.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance

Our revenues, profit, margins and other results of operations can be influenced by a variety of factors in any given period, including those described under
the section entitled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this prospectus, and those factors have caused fluctuations in our results in the past and are expected to cause fluctuations in our results of operations in the future. Additional
information with respect to such factors is provided below.

Seasonal and Severe Weather Conditions.
The results of our business in a given period
can be impacted by seasonal and adverse weather conditions, severe weather events, natural disasters or other emergencies. Such events include, among other things, heavy or prolonged snowfall or rainfall, hurricanes, tropical storms,



87





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



tornadoes, floods, blizzards, extreme temperatures, wildfires and earthquakes. Adverse weather conditions can affect project margins in a given period. For example, extended periods of rain
or snowfall can negatively affect revenue and project margins due to reduced productivity from projects being delayed or temporarily halted. Climate change has the potential to increase the frequency and extremity of severe weather events.
These conditions and events can negatively impact our financial results due to, among other things, the termination, deferral or delay of projects, reduced productivity and exposure to significant liabilities due to failure of electrical power or
other infrastructure on which we have performed services.

Project Margins
. Overall project margins may fluctuate period to period due to
project pricing and job conditions, changes in the cost of labor and materials, availability and cost of components and materials, crew availability, job productivity and work volume. Job productivity can be affected by a number of factors,
including unexpected project difficulties or site conditions, quality of the work crew and equipment, the quality of engineering specifications and designs, availability of skilled labor, availability and cost of components and materials, inclement
weather or severe weather events, environmental or regulatory factors, customer decisions or delays and crew productivity.

Permitting and
Interconnection
.

Our projects typically require interconnection and permitting prior to commencing construction, and we may be affected by regulatory and utility delays as a result. Permitting and interconnection related delays are beyond
our control and can negatively impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the required delivery schedule, performance requirements or achieve our anticipated margin on the project. While we may seek to recover our additional costs
resulting from our customers’ delays, those costs may not be recoverable, and in some cases, we may even be required to compensate the customer for such delays, including in circumstances where we have guaranteed project completion or
performance by a scheduled date and incur liquidated damages if we do not meet such schedule.

Inflation
. Our operations are affected by increases
in prices, whether caused by inflation, rising interest rates or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, equipment, fuel and materials through price escalation provisions that allow us to adjust
billing rates for certain major contracts annually; by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work; or by entering into

back-to-back
contracts with suppliers and subcontractors.

Tariffs.

Our business may be affected by tariffs that increase the cost of materials and equipment we use, which we try to mitigate through contractual protections with our customers, price increases and other cost reduction measures. The potential for
continued economic uncertainty may have adverse impacts to the levels of future customer contracts and our future business operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We caution that significant uncertainty remains due to supply chain
challenges, inflationary costs, ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, especially with the latest tariff announcements, and the possible impact on trade between the U.S. and the rest of the world, among other factors.

Costs Related to Becoming a Public Company

To operate as
a public company, we will be required to continue to implement changes in certain aspects of our business and develop, manage and train management level and other employees to comply with ongoing public company requirements. We will also incur new
expenses as a public company, including, among others, public reporting obligations, costs to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased professional fees for accounting, proxy statements and stockholder meetings, equity plan administration,
stock exchange fees, transfer agent fees, SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA fees, filing fees, legal fees and offering expenses. In addition, upon the completion of this offering, we will be a party to the Tax
Receivable Agreement with the TRA Participants and will be required to make certain payments to them in accordance with the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. See “—Effects of the Transactions.”

Effects of the Transactions

SOLV Energy, Inc. was formed
for the purpose of this offering and has engaged to date only in activities in contemplation of this offering. SOLV Energy, Inc. will be a holding company, and its sole material asset will be



88





Table of Contents

its ownership interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. For more information regarding our reorganization and holding company structure, see “Our Organizational
Structure—Transactions.” Upon completion of this offering, all of our business will be conducted through SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the financial results of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and its consolidated
subsidiaries will be included in the consolidated financial statements of SOLV Energy, Inc.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings
LLC was historically an entity disregarded as separate from SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP, an entity taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a disregarded entity, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC was not subject to U.S. federal
income tax. In connection with the Transactions, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will become a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, either prior to or as a result of SOLV Energy, Inc.’s acquisition of LLC Interests. As a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. As a result of its direct or indirect ownership of LLC Interests, SOLV Energy, Inc. will become subject to U.S. federal, state and
local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, SOLV Energy, Inc. also will incur expenses related to our
operations and it will be required to make payments to the TRA Participants in accordance with the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments that we may be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the TRA Participants may be significant.

Revenue

Revenue decreased by $244.6 million to $1,870.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $2,115.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of a reduction in EPC projects of $155.8 million due to increased selectivity of projects with a focus of driving higher margins and profitability, lower development sales of
$34.0 million due to timing of construction completion, and exiting construction management projects of $67.0 million, partially offset by increased maintenance services of $15.5 million.

Cost of revenue

The decrease in cost of revenue were
driven by productivity efficiencies, improved pricing and exiting construction management activities for certain customers.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $37.2 million to $134.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2024 compared to $97.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of a $26.7 million higher bonus cost and additional changes of $10.5 million related to more investment in the
organization to support administrative needs and new growth.

Amortization expense

Amortization expense decreased by $0.7 million to $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $67.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023, as a result of fully amortizing intangible assets during the year.

Loss on extinguishment of debt

Loss on debt extinguishment increased to $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of consolidating debt upon the completion of the CS Merger.

Interest expense

Interest expense decreased by $4.3 million to $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $59.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of lower average outstanding balances of our debt, which resulted in a reduction of interest expense of $3.0 million and lower floating interest rates on the Term Loans, which are reset
quarterly, resulting in lower interest expense of $1.7 million.

Interest income

Interest income increased by $3.0 million to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of interest on delayed payments from a customer, which resulted in interest income of $2.3 million, and higher interest income on higher cash balances, which resulted in higher interest income of
$0.7 million.

Other income, net

Other income,
net decreased by $0.5 million to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the $1.3 million for the year ended 2023, primarily from a $0.7 million decrease in income from development projects and a
$0.2 million loss on the disposal of assets, partially offset by a $0.1 gain due to a fair value adjustment on an interest rate swap.

Revenue

Revenue decreased by $213.3 million to
$2,115.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2,328.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to timing in the completion of EPC projects, which resulted in decreased revenue of
$322.8 million. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $60.1 million from a large construction management project, increased development sales of $34.2 million, and increased maintenance services of $15.2 million.


Cost of revenue

Cost of revenue primarily includes
employee compensation, costs for subcontractors, equipment rentals, materials and supplies, insurance, depreciation of property and equipment and software, and other direct and indirect costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $7.3 million to $97.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to
$104.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a $5.1 million decrease in bonus awards and lower corporate administrative costs of $2.0 million.

Amortization expenses

Amortization expense decreased by
$11.9 million to $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $79.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of fully amortizing intangible assets during the year.

Interest expense

Interest expense increased by
$20.0 million to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $39.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on the Term Loans, which are reset quarterly,
resulting in higher interest expense of $13.9 million and higher average outstanding balances on our debt, which resulted in an increase of interest expense of $5.1 million.

Interest Income

Interest income increased by
$1.4 million to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of higher interest rates, which are based on benchmark floating rates.


Other income, net

Other income, net increased by
$1.3 million to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the $0.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of an increased investment income on development projects of
$1.5 million, partially offset by $0.2 million increase in the loss on the remeasurement of our interest rate derivative.

Income tax expense


Income tax expense, net increased by $0.2 million to $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to changes in state business mix.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Liquidity

We have historically funded
our operations and business activities primarily from cash flows from operating activities as well as borrowings under our Credit Facilities (as defined herein). Our principal uses of cash include cash used in operations, cash payments for property
and equipment, distributions to Original Equity Owners and payments made pursuant to the terms of our Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2024, we had $208.0 million of cash and $78.9 million of undrawn availability under our
Revolving Facility (as defined herein).

Prior to the completion of this offering, our primary funding needs will be to fund operations, purchase property
and equipment, make distributions to Original Equity Owners, make payments pursuant to the terms of our Credit Facilities, and fund business development activity, including acquisitions. To address these short-term liquidity requirements, we
anticipate relying on our existing cash, the net cash flows generated by our operations and availability under our Revolving Facility. In 2025, we estimate total capital expenditures in the range of $10.0 million to $15.0 million.



92

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



After the completion of this offering, we expect that our primary funding needs will be to fund operations,
purchase property and equipment, make payments under our Tax Receivable Agreement, make distributions to our Continuing Equity Owners, make payments pursuant to the terms of our Credit Facilities, pay income taxes and fund business development
activities, including acquisitions.

SOLV Energy, Inc. was formed for the purpose of this offering and has engaged to date only in activities in
contemplation of this offering. SOLV Energy, Inc. is a holding company with no material assets other than its ownership of the LLC Interests. As a consequence, our ability to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock,
pay taxes and make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is subject to the ability of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to provide distributions to us. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC for any
reason could limit or impair SOLV Energy Holdings LLC’s ability to pay such distributions to us. Additionally, to the extent that we need funds and SOLV Energy Holdings LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or
regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or SOLV Energy Holdings LLC is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.

We anticipate that the distributions we will receive from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC may, in certain periods, exceed our actual tax liabilities and obligations
to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which may include, among other uses, to
pay dividends on our Class A common stock. We have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other than any declared dividend) to our stockholders. To the extent that we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on
our Class A common stock or otherwise take ameliorative actions between LLC Interests and shares of Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances, holders of LLC Interests (other than SOLV Energy, Inc.) may benefit
from any value attributable to such cash balances if they acquire shares of Class A common stock in exchange for their LLC Interests, notwithstanding that such holders may have participated previously as holders of LLC Interests in
distributions that resulted in such excess cash balances.

We will enter into a Tax Receivable Agreement, which would provide for payment to the TRA
Participants of a percentage of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize or are deemed to realize in certain circumstances (calculated using certain assumptions). Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be our obligations and not
obligations of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC. Any payments made by us under the Tax Receivable Agreement would generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us or SOLV Energy Holdings LLC.

We believe that our existing cash balances, cash flows from our operations and borrowings under our Revolving Facility will be sufficient to fund our
operations for at least the next twelve months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including significant expenditures that may be required to conduct our operations. There can be no assurance that operations and other
capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of expenditures or to make future acquisitions. In the event that the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available, we could be
required to reduce the expected level of expenditures and/or seek additional capital. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the proceeds from this offering, the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, the issuance of additional equity, or a combination thereof. If we seek additional capital, we may do so through additional borrowings under our Credit Facilities, offerings of debt or equity securities, other financing
transactions, joint ventures, asset sales, or other means. We cannot guarantee that such additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our
capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors.” If we are unable to generate sufficient
cash flow from operations or otherwise obtain the additional capital we need, we may not be able to finance the expenditures necessary to conduct our operations or to make acquisitions. If we decide to incur additional debt or to sell or issue
additional equity to finance our operations or acquisitions, any

such decision could result in additional expenses, the entry into debt agreements with covenants that limit our operational or financial flexibility or additional dilution to our stockholders.


Revolving Facility

On December 23, 2021,
we entered into the Opco RCF Credit Agreement (as defined herein) with various lenders, pursuant to which such lenders agreed to provide total commitments in an aggregate principal amount equal to $60.0 million. On October 7, 2024, the
Opco RCF Credit Agreement was amended to increase the total commitments under the Revolving Facility to an aggregate principal amount of $90.0 million. The Revolving Facility bears interest, at our option, at the highest of (a) the Federal
Funds Effective Rate, plus 0.50%, (b) the Prime Rate, or (c) the Term SOFR (in each case as such term is defined in the Opco RCF Credit Agreement) for a
one-month
tenor (not less than the applicable
floor) plus 1.00%. The Revolving Facility is subject to an annual unused line fee of 0.50%. Key financial covenants under the Revolving Facility include maintaining a leverage ratio that does not exceed 6.50 to 1.0, an interest coverage ratio that
exceeds 2.25 to 1.0, and a fixed charge coverage ratio that exceeds 1.20 to 1.0. We are not aware of any instances of noncompliance with the key financial covenants as of March 31, 2025. The Revolving Facility matures on October 7, 2028. See
“Description of Material Indebtedness” for a discussion of the terms of the Revolving Facility.

As of December 31, 2024, we had no
outstanding cash borrowings and $11.1 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Revolving Facility.

Term Loans

On October 7, 2024, we entered into the Holdco Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined herein) with various lenders, pursuant to which such lenders agreed
to provide an initial term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $373.7 million. On January 9, 2025, the Holdco Term Loan Credit Agreement was amended to provide an additional incremental commitment of $32.5 million.
Borrowings under the Holdco Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate equal to either (a) Term SOFR plus 6.75% or (b) the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Holdco Term Loan Credit Agreement) plus
5.75%, in each case, subject to a 1.00% floor. Prior to January 9, 2025, borrowings under the Holdco Term Loan Credit Agreement amortized at an annual rate equal to 1.00%, which was payable in equal quarterly installments of 0.25% of the
original principal amount. As of March 31, 2025, the Holdco Term Loan Credit Agreement requires to make quarterly amortization payments for the Term Loans (as defined herein) in an aggregate amount equal to $1,015,672.38, which payment is to be
made on the last day of each of March, June, September and December. We are not aware of any instances of noncompliance with the key financial covenants as of March 31, 2025. The Term Loans mature on October 7, 2029. See “Description of
Material Indebtedness” for a discussion of the terms of the Term Loans.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $372.7 million outstanding
under the Holdco Term Loan Credit Agreement.

Equipment Financing

We currently have an equipment term loan within an initial principal amount of $25.0 million, with certain owned construction equipment as collateral. The
equipment term loan has a
one-time
late payment fee equal to five percent on the sum of unpaid rent ten days overdue. For any other subsequent overdue payments, such amount will bear interest at eighteen
percent per annum until paid. We did note incur any late payment penalties during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.

As of
December 31, 2024 we had $23.9 million of debt outstanding under the equipment term loan.

Contractual Obligations

Significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024, including the future periods in which payments are expected, include our long-term debt
obligations. As of December 31, 2024, we had $369.0 million and $3.7 million of long-term and short-term debt, respectively, outstanding.

Operating activities

Net
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a net cash inflow of $117.6 million, an increase of $67.3 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $50.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily driven by incremental net income of $126.1 million, adjusted for
non-cash
items, primarily offset by higher cash outflows of $58.8 million related
to operating assets and liabilities.

Net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, was a net cash inflow of
$50.3 million, a decrease of $33.6 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by higher cash outflows of $39.8 million related to
operating assets and liabilities and incremental net loss of $6.2 million, adjusted for
non-cash
items.

Investing activities

Net cash flow used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a net cash outflow of $8.3 million, a decrease of $5.6 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease was
primarily driven by a $5.8 million decrease in capital expenditures, a $2.5 million decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities, and an increase of $0.3 million from the proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.
Partially offsetting this decrease is a $3.0 million decrease in distributions from investments.

Key Performance Indicators

and

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures

In managing our business and assessing financial performance, we supplement the information provided by the consolidated financial statements with other
financial and operating metrics. These operating metrics are utilized by our management to evaluate our business performance, identify trends affecting our business and facilitate long-term strategic planning.

Backlog

We use backlog to forecast our future capital
needs and to identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. We present two measures of backlog: (1) Next 12 Months Backlog, which includes Signed Backlog and Awarded Backlog, and Estimated Corrective Maintenance Backlog
that we anticipate will be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months, and (2) Total Backlog, which includes all Signed Backlog and Awarded Backlog, and Estimated Corrective Maintenance Backlog.

Backlog is a measure commonly used in our industry but not recognized under GAAP. We believe this measure enables management to more effectively forecast our
future revenues and identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. We believe this measure is also useful for investors in forecasting our future results and comparing us to our competitors. Our methodology for determining
backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.

Gross Margin

Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by total revenue. We use this metric because it provides insights into the profitability of our jobs and helps
us make informed decisions about our cost management.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

In addition to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of
our business. The key
non-GAAP
measures we use are EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.

EBITDA represents net income
(loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude:
(i) non-cash
compensation expense; (ii) the (gain) or loss on the
disposal of assets and the extinguishment of debt; (iii) the change in fair value of derivatives; (iv) asset impairment charges;
(v) non-recurring
private equity management fees; and
(vi) certain other items which we do not consider indicative of future operating performance such as
one-time
legal settlements not considered part of normal course business operations, transaction,
integration, severance, transition and other non-cash costs. We adjust for these items in our Adjusted EBITDA as our management believes these items would distort from their ability to efficiently view and assess core operating trends.

Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by these items. We present EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. Our board of directors, management and investors use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess
our financial performance because such measures allow them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as
depreciation and amortization) and items outside the control of our management team (such as income taxes).

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined
under GAAP. Our use of the terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to operating income (loss), net income
(loss), earnings per share, net sales, net income margin or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools, and such measures should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute
for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations include:





•




EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service
interest or principal payments on our debt;





•




EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes;



97





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.





•




Although depreciation and amortization are
non-cash
charges, the assets
being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and





•




Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness
as comparative measures.

In evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar
to those eliminated in this prospectus.

The following table reconciles the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and net income (loss), which is the most
comparable GAAP measure:

audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for further information.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates


We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. There are certain accounting principles that require management to make
judgments and estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which could potentially
result in materially different results under



98

different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Our estimates
are based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. To the extent that there are differences
between estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus; however, the
following discussion pertains to accounting policies we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Other
companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may affect the comparability of our financial statements, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue from contracts
with customers when, or as, control of the promised services and goods is transferred to the customers. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the services and goods transferred.


EPC Service Contracts.
EPC services are generally accounted for as a single performance obligation. We recognize EPC services revenue using the
percentage-of-completion
method (an input method), based on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract costs include
our latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs, materials, subcontractor costs, among other costs. Changes to total estimated costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined to be
assessed at the contract level.

O&M Service Contracts.
O&M service contracts may include multiple performance obligations. We allocate the
transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. For standard O&M service contracts with specified service periods, revenue is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the service period when inputs are expended evenly, and the customer receives and consumes the benefits of performance throughout the contract term. For other O&M agreements that are performed based on time and materials
rates, such as repair, replacement, and refurbishment services, progress towards complete satisfaction of such performance obligations is measured using an output method as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of performance completed to
date.

Development Revenues.
Revenues recognized by us from the sale of development projects are recognized at a point in time when control of the
related project transfers to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the project.

Variable Consideration.
The nature of our contracts gives rise to variable consideration, including change orders, unpriced change orders and
liquidated damage penalties. Change orders are generally not distinct performance obligations from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract. We recognize revenue for variable
consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We estimate the amount of revenue to be
recognized on variable consideration by using the expected value or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount.

Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of the
anticipated performance and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available including, but not limited to, contractual entitlement and specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with customers. Amounts
associated with change orders are



99

recognized as revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted, and the amount of such adjustment can be reliably estimated. The effect of variable consideration on the
transaction price, and our measure of progress for the performance obligation for which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative
catch-up
basis.

Goodwill

We have goodwill that has been recorded in
connection with our acquisitions of businesses. Goodwill represents the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of our
fiscal year, or more frequently if triggering events occur. Goodwill is required to be tested at the reporting unit level. We determined that we have two reporting units for the purposes of goodwill impairment.

We assess goodwill using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit
is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment considers enterprise value, macroeconomic conditions, cost factors and other industry and market conditions. If it is determined, based upon a qualitative assessment, that it is more
likely than not that the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative assessment estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using income and market
approaches and compares that amount to the carrying value of that reporting unit. In the event the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the excess, limited to
the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

In connection with the 2024, 2023 and 2022 annual goodwill impairment assessments,
management elected to bypass performing qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to performing quantitative impairment tests of our reporting units. The results of these quantitative tests indicated the fair value of our reporting units
exceeded its carrying amount and therefore, no goodwill impairment charge was recognized in 2024, 2023 or 2022. Changes in facts and circumstances, judgments and assumptions used to determine these fair values, including with respect to market
conditions and the economy, could result in impairment charges in the future that could be material to our financial statements.

Income Taxes

SOLV Energy Holdings LLC is currently an entity disregarded as separate from SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In connection
with the Transactions, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC will become taxed as a partnership under the appropriate provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, federal income taxes are payable by the unit-holders and no provisions are made for federal
income taxes in the consolidated financial statements. Although various state and local income taxes are imposed on a “flow-through” basis and are thus payable by the unit-holders, the Company has historically been subject to certain state
and local income taxes at the entity level.

After the consummation of this offering, we will become subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes
with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations, plus expected payments
under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which may be significant. We intend to cause SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our tax obligations and operating expenses, including distributions to fund
any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We anticipate that we will account for the income tax effects and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement’s effects resulting from future taxable exchanges or redemptions of LLC Interests held
by Continuing Equity Owners by recognizing an increase in deferred tax assets, based on enacted tax rates at the date of the purchase or redemption.

Further, we will evaluate the likelihood that we will realize the benefit represented by the deferred tax
asset and, to the extent that we estimate that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit, we will reduce the carrying amount of the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance. The amounts to be recorded for both the deferred
tax assets and the liability for our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be estimated at the time of any purchase or redemption and is expected to be accounted for as a reduction to member’s equity, and the effects of changes in
any of our estimates after this date will be included in net income (loss). Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income (loss). In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized and, when necessary, a valuation allowance is established. The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation
of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. A change in the assessment of such consequences, such as realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof could
materially impact our results.

Under the provisions of ASC 740,
Income Taxes
, as it relates to accounting for uncertainties in tax positions, we
recognize the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax
position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances.

Unit-Based Compensation

We have granted unit-based awards consisting of restricted stock unit appreciation (“RUA”) and Restricted Class C Units to certain employees. We
recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the requisite service period. The RUA and certain Restricted Class C Units vest following time-based vesting conditions. Other Restricted Class C Units vest following a
performance-based or MOIC-based vesting schedules. The performance condition is predicated on the achievement of certain EBITDA targets. Regardless of whether these targets are met, these performance-based awards fully vest on the eighth anniversary
of the grant date. The MOIC condition awards vest upon a liquidity event once the multiple of at least 2.5 times can be determined. Because the liquidity event is not considered probable until it actually occurs, no compensation costs related to the
MOIC conditioned Restricted Class C Units have been recognized.

The fair value of each RUA is based on cash the amount a holder would receive upon
the award’s vesting, which is equal to the fair value of a Class A Unit of SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP. The fair value of the Class A Units of SOLV Energy Parent Holdings, LP are estimated using generally accepted equity valuation
and allocation methods.

We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to estimate the fair value of the Restricted Class C Units granted. The Black-Scholes
option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the price of our Restricted Class C Units, the expected dividend yield, and the expected time to
liquidity. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Restricted Class C Units represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. Unit-based compensation
expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for forfeitures as they occur. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our unit-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2024, we had no
off-balance
sheet arrangements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse
changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure to potential changes in interest rates or inflation and the resulting impact on investment income and interest expense. We do not hold financial
instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

Our results of operations are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on borrowings under our Credit Facilities, which carry variable interest rates.
Because our borrowings bear interest at a variable rate, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. We are also exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments. We fix a portion of our debt through the use of interest rate derivative contracts to manage the risk of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024, a 100 basis
point increase or decrease in interest rates would change our annual interest expense by approximately $4.0 million.

Inflation Risk

Inflation can have an impact on our contract costs and our operating costs. A prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates, fuel, wages and other
costs to increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations unless our corresponding contract revenues correspondingly increase. However, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition
or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

BUSINESS

Our Company

We are a leading provider of infrastructure
services to the power industry, including engineering, procurement, construction, testing, commissioning, operations, maintenance and repowering. We have constructed more than 500 power plants representing 20 GW
dc
of generating capacity since we were founded in 2008, and we currently provide O&M services under long-term agreements to 144 operating power plants representing over 17 GW
dc
of generating capacity. Engineering News Record ranks us



and



in the United States in the solar
and power contractor categories, respectively, based on 2024 revenues.

We specialize in designing, building and maintaining utility-scale solar and
battery storage projects with capacities of 200 MW
dc
and larger and related T&D infrastructure. We were the largest builder of new utility-scale solar energy projects in the United States
based on the number of MW
dc
constructed from 2014 to 2023 according to Solar Power World and the second largest provider of O&M services to existing utility-scale solar energy projects in
the Americas based on the number of MW
dc
managed in 2023 according to Wood Mackenzie. As of June 30, 2025,

% of our total backlog was EPC services for
new construction projects and

% was O&M services for existing infrastructure. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Backlog” for a
discussion of our backlog.

Demand for new generation capacity and related infrastructure services is growing rapidly in the United States. The
combination of growth in the number and capacity of data centers, manufacturing reshoring, increasing use of HVAC caused by more extreme weather, electrification of industrial processes and retirement of existing coal-fired generation facilities are
resulting in rapid load growth that cannot be met by existing generation capacity. According to Wood Mackenzie, an average of     GW
ac
of new generation capacity will be
constructed annually in the United States from 2025 through 2034 which is      the prior
ten-year
period’s average. Solar and battery storage projects will account for nearly
% of the capacity added from 2025 through 2034 according to Wood Mackenzie as they are easier to permit, use equipment that is more readily available, deliver a lower levelized cost of energy and are faster to build than competing forms of
power generation such as gas and nuclear. As of June 30, 2025, we had backlog of approximately $   billion.

Our customers include
project developers, independent power producers and utilities. Our new construction projects are typically executed over 12 to 18 months pursuant to one or more LNTP agreements followed by a lump sum EPC contract. Under LNTP agreements, our
customers pay us to perform initial engineering and site investigation work, procure long lead time equipment and begin initial mobilization of our workforce and equipment, the results of which we use to refine our price to construct the project.
LNTP agreements significantly reduce our risk because they allow us to identify unforeseen costs and incorporate them into our price
prior
to entering into the EPC contract. Our customers also benefit from LNTP agreements because they reduce
the probability that there will be unforeseen change orders or delays during construction. See “—Customer Contracts—EPC Services” for a discussion of our EPC contracting process and typical provisions.

We provide O&M services pursuant to long-term contracts that typically obligate the customer to pay us a fixed fee for operations and routine preventative
maintenance and additional fees for corrective maintenance on a time and materials basis. Our O&M contracts typically have a minimum term of five years and renew automatically for successive one year periods at the end of the initial term. When
a customer enters into an O&M agreement with us, they typically give us operational control of their power plants which we manage through a
NERC-registered
medium impact control center located in our San
Diego headquarters. Our control center enables us to provide our customers remote monitoring, diagnostic and dispatch capabilities on a 24/7 basis. Many of our customers that use us to build new power plants also use our O&M services. See
“—Customer Contracts—O&M Services” for a discussion of our O&M contracting process and typical provisions.

We were
founded in 2008 as Swinerton Renewable Energy (“SRE”) and operated as a division of Swinerton Builders, one of the largest employee-owned commercial construction firms in the U.S. and a wholly-owned

subsidiary of Swinerton. We were acquired by American Securities in December 2021, along with SOLV, Inc., a subsidiary we formed in 2012 to provide operating and maintenance services to both
in-house
and third-party power plants. Following our acquisition by American Securities, SRE and SOLV Inc. were rebranded SOLV Energy. In October 2024, we merged with CS Energy, LLC, a leading provider of EPC
services for solar and battery storage focused on the East and Southeast regions of the United States.

We are headquartered in San Diego, California and
have 14 additional offices located across the United States. We operate a NERC CIP certified control center in our San Diego headquarters that we use to monitor and manage the operations of our customers’ power plants. We employ approximately
1,600 team members specializing in engineering, project management, electrical systems, safety and compliance, innovation and technology, business development, marketing, finance, human resources and talent development. Our employees collaborate
across diverse scopes of work, resulting in continuous improvement, enhanced communication and greater efficiency that creates value for our customers.

Our Lifecycle Approach

We offer an integrated suite of
services to meet the needs of our customers throughout the entire lifecycle of their projects, from initial design through operation. Our services for new projects include engineering, equipment procurement, construction, testing and commissioning.
We generally refer to these services as “EPC services.” Our services for existing projects include monitoring, preventative maintenance, corrective maintenance, upgrading and repowering. We generally refer to these services as
“O&M services” and the combination of EPC and O&M services as our “lifecycle approach.” We believe we are the only top five EPC that offers O&M services at scale and the only top five O&M services provider that
offers EPC services at scale. We have designed our service offering with the goal of becoming a long-term partner to our customers who creates value for them throughout the life of their projects. We believe our lifecycle approach enables us to:






•




Demonstrate
value-add
to customers by increasing their revenue
potential and reducing their O&M costs, rather than just minimizing initial construction cost.
According to NREL, the average owner of a utility-scale solar plus storage project will generate revenues equal to more than
times its EPC cost and spend more than 1.6x times its EPC cost on operations and maintenance over the project’s lifetime. Because revenues and O&M costs are much greater than EPC costs, relatively small
investments in energy generation, equipment uptime and maintenance expenses can be more valuable to the customer than a lower EPC price. To put that in context, a 2% improvement in energy generation that results in a 2% improvement in revenues over
the project’s lifetime is equivalent to a more than   % reduction in EPC costs and a 2% reduction in O&M costs over the project’s lifetime is equivalent to nearly a   % reduction in EPC costs using NREL’s
PV System Cost Model. Under our lifecycle approach, we work with our customers to design their projects, select equipment and integrate the systems on site to maximize energy generation and minimize unnecessary maintenance. We also seek to provide
ongoing O&M services after the project is operational to ensure it delivers peak performance. Our competitors who only provide construction services do not have the long-term operating data that we have access to through our O&M services so
we do not believe they can offer the same insights into project design, equipment selection and system integration that we can. Our competitors who only provide O&M services are limited in their ability to influence the performance of a project
because they do not play a role in designing the project or selecting the equipment used in it like we do.





•




Bring our customers capabilities that “O&M only” companies cannot.
Through our new
construction business, we have significant resources, including more than 725 craftworkers and technicians, and a fleet of over 850 vehicles and trucks and more than 200 pieces of earthmoving and other heavy equipment. We use these resources to
provide services to our O&M customers that we believe most “O&M only” companies are unable to self-perform, including repairing major damage from weather events such as hailstorms, hurricanes and tornadoes; performing major
equipment upgrades; expanding sites to add incremental generation capacity or battery storage; and repowering.



104

•




Generate long-term, recurring revenues.
Our lifecycle approach creates recurring revenues through
multi-year O&M agreements and related corrective maintenance work on both the power plant and its transmission infrastructure. We have historically generated annual corrective maintenance revenues equal to 80% to 90% of the amount our customers
pay us in fixed fees for operations and preventative maintenance. Our O&M contracts have a minimum term of five years and typically renew automatically at the end of the term for successive one year terms.





•




Create incumbency that makes it difficult for our competitors to displace us.
Solar energy and battery
storage projects have useful lives of 35 years and 20 years, respectively, according to the EIA, and a power plant’s interconnection can be renewed indefinitely. Our lifecycle approach creates continuous interaction with our customers and their
projects, which gives us knowledge of their facilities and operations that no other service providers have. We have maintained an
on-site
presence at some of our customers projects since we began offering
O&M services. Continuous interaction with our customers and their sites creates incumbency that we believe makes it difficult for our competitors to displace us.





•




Identify new business opportunities our competitors may never see.
We remotely monitor and have a constant

on-site
presence at, or have our service technicians routinely visit, all of the power plants we manage. Our continuous interaction with our customers’ projects allows us to identify maintenance,
expansion and repowering opportunities at their sites that our competitors may never see.





•




Maximize our revenue potential from each project.
According to NREL, the average owner of a utility-scale
solar plus battery storage project will spend $0.84 per watt
dc
on EPC services, $0.07 per watt
dc
on asset management, $0.21 per watt
dc
on preventative maintenance and $1.07 per watt
dc
on corrective maintenance over its 35 year life. We believe our lifecycle approach enables
us to maximize our revenue potential from every project we build by providing services throughout the project’s entire lifecycle.





•




Leverage long-term operating data to improve construction methods, make better equipment selections, improve
uptime and increase energy generation.
Our control center captures approximately 2 million data points per second on every power plant that we manage. We have accumulated more than 50 terabytes of operating data across the power plants
we monitor through Vitals, which we believe represents one of the largest repositories of operating data on solar and battery storage projects in the world. We use the operating data that we have gathered to improve our construction methods and make
better equipment selections as well as gain insights into ways to improve uptime and increase energy generation for our customers.

Our Market Opportunity

New Construction.
Demand
for our EPC services is driven primarily by investment in new generation generally and solar and battery storage projects with capacities of 200 MW
dc
and larger in the United States,
specifically. According to NREL, EPC costs represent approximately 41% of the total cost of a new utility-scale solar plus battery storage project. According to the EIA, 82% of the new generation capacity added in the United States in 2024 was solar
and battery storage, and annual investment in new utility-scale solar and battery storage projects with capacities of 200 MW
ac
and larger will grow from $   billion in 2024 to
$   billion in 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate of  %, according to Wood Mackenzie. We believe key drivers supporting continued growth in demand for new solar and battery storage projects include:





•




Accelerating load growth.
Electricity consumption in the United States will grow 17.3% from 2024 to 2034
compared with only 5.2% over the prior
10-year
period from 2014 to 2024 according to the EIA and Wood Mackenzie. Demand for power is growing rapidly as businesses move manufacturing operations back to the
United States, companies make investments in energy-intensive digital infrastructure, more extreme temperatures cause businesses and consumers to require more HVAC and more commercial and industrial processes are electrified.





•




Shorter lead times compared to other forms of generation.
Utility-scale solar energy projects can
typically be constructed in approximately one year or less, which compares to approximately three years and



105





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.







nine years for natural
gas-fired
and nuclear power plants, respectively, according to BNEF. The lead time required for new natural
gas-fired
generation may also grow in the future as several major gas turbine manufacturers have reported multi-year order backlogs and sold out capacity. The shorter lead times required to bring new solar energy
and battery storage projects online make them an attractive source of new generation capacity in regions with accelerating load growth.





•




Lower cost and less environmental impact than natural
gas-fired

generation.
Solar energy offers the lowest cost of new generation capacity in the United States, according to Wood Mackenzie, and the generation of solar energy does not emit any greenhouse gases. This makes solar energy an attractive source of
new generation capacity to utilities, corporations and the public when compared to new
gas-fired
generation. The falling cost of battery technologies is also making it possible for solar to compete with
natural
gas-fired
as economical base load generation in certain areas of the United States.





•




Retirements of coal-fired generation.
Nearly    GW
ac
of coal-fired and other generating capacity representing  % of the existing generation fleet in the United States as of
year-end
2024 is slated to be
retired from 2025 through 2034 according to the Wood Mackenzie. In most cases, these facilities must be replaced with new power plants to ensure the regions they serve will have adequate power to meet the growing needs of businesses and consumers.


Existing Infrastructure.
Demand for our O&M services is driven primarily by the number and capacity of operating
utility-scale solar energy and battery storage projects and their age. Older projects typically require more maintenance, including inverter replacements and battery augmentation. According to NREL, the average owner of a utility-scale solar plus
battery storage project will spend approximately 1.6x times the project’s original EPC cost on O&M over its lifetime. Spending on O&M for solar energy and battery storage projects will grow from
$


billion in 2025 to $



billion in 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate of

% according to Wood Mackenzie. We
believe key drivers supporting continued growth in demand for our O&M services include:





•




Rapidly growing installed base.
According to Wood Mackenzie, the capacity of operating utility-scale solar
energy and battery storage projects in the United States will increase from    GW
dc
and    GW
ac
at
the end of 2024 to nearly    GW
dc
and    GW
ac
, at the end of 2034, respectively, representing
compound annual growth rates of  % and  %, respectively. As the total capacity of solar energy and battery storage projects increase so will spending on O&M services.





•




Aging fleet that will require increasing levels of maintenance.
According to Wood Mackenzie,
GW
ac
and    GW
ac
of solar energy and battery storage projects will be more than ten years old by
the end of 2030 and 2034, respectively, compared to only     GW
ac
and     GW
ac
, respectively, at the
end of 2024. Most solar energy and battery storage projects require major maintenance following their tenth year of operation, including inverter replacements and battery augmentation. As the installed base of solar and battery storage projects ages
so will spending on corrective maintenance to address equipment failures.





•




Increasing return on investment from repowering.
Owners of existing solar energy projects can increase
their revenues by adding battery storage, replacing existing solar modules with newer models that generate more power and upgrading inverters to high efficiency models. We believe that rising power prices, falling battery prices and increasing
equipment performance make repowering more attractive as projects age. From 2020 to 2024, the average wholesale power price in the United States increased 45%, while the average price per kWh for
lithium-ion

stationary batteries decreased nearly 30% and the average efficiency of a solar module increased 14% according to the EIA and BNEF.

Our Strengths

We believe the following strengths position us to capitalize on continued growth in demand for the services we provide, reinforce our leadership position in
the markets we focus on, and differentiate us from our competitors:





•




Long history, large scale and market leadership.
We have been building, operating and maintaining solar
energy projects continuously for over 15 years. We have constructed more than 500 power plants across 35 states. We are one of a small number of companies that has completed solar energy projects 200 MW
dc
or larger. We were the largest builder of solar energy projects in the United States from 2014 to 2023 according to Solar Power World and the second largest independent provider of O&M
services to solar energy projects in the Americas in 2023 according to Wood Mackenzie. We believe our long history, large scale and market leadership give us several advantages over our smaller competitors with less operating history, including:






•




giving prospective customers confidence that we have the financial and operational resources to complete large,
complex projects;





•




being recognized by our customers’ lenders as a “bankable” service provider that reduces execution
and operational risk, which we believe translates to better financing terms for our customers;





•




giving us the experience and operating data to accurately price risk;





•




obtaining preferential terms from equipment suppliers;





•




making it easier to attract and retain talented employees;





•




benefiting from proprietary means and methods developed over millions of hours of experience building and
maintaining projects;





•




giving us the financial strength to make investments in construction equipment such as pile drivers, boring
machines, deep foundation drills, trenchers and customized solar production equipment that give us operational advantages; and





•




reducing the risk that any single project or conditions in a particular region of the country pose to our
financial performance.





•




Lifecycle approach that differentiates us from our competitors, creates recurring revenues and maximizes our
revenue potential from each project.
We believe we are the only top five EPC that also offers O&M services at scale and the only top five O&M services provider that also offers EPC services at scale. We believe providing both EPC and
O&M services differentiates us from our competitors that only provide EPC services because customers see us as a long-term partner that can add value to their operations throughout the entire lifecycle of their projects rather than a contractor
for a particular job. Providing both EPC and O&M services also allows us to create recurring revenues and maximize our revenue potential from every project we build because we can generate revenue from our customers every year over the entire
life of their projects.





•




Industry-Leading O&M Capabilities.
We have developed a comprehensive set of O&M capabilities that
enable us to serve the needs of owners after their power plants commence operations, including a NERC-registered medium impact operations center that provides 24/7 monitoring and control for power plants, a team of over 174 field service technicians
that are authorized to perform warranty work on most major brands of equipment used by our customers and a proprietary software platform called Vitals that integrates with our customers’ SCADA systems to provide real-time system performance
information.





•




Contracting process that minimizes construction risk through LNTP agreements.
We typically engage with
customers on new construction projects by entering into an initial LNTP agreement pursuant to which the customer pays us for engineering and site investigation work, including in depth soil and foundation pile testing. The initial LNTP agreement
allows us to thoroughly evaluate site conditions and incorporate them into our price for the project. Following the initial LNTP agreement, we typically enter into additional LNTP agreements for procurement of long-lead time equipment and initial
site mobilization before we enter



107

into a lump sum EPC contract with our customer. All of the services we provide pursuant to LNTP agreements are prepaid by the customer through deposits that are due on signing of the agreement.
LNTP agreements significantly reduce our risk because they allow us to identify unforeseen costs and incorporate them into our price
prior
to entering into the EPC contract. Our customers also benefit from LNTP agreements because they reduce
the probability that there will be unforeseen change orders or delays during construction.

Direct beneficiary of accelerating load growth and the retirement of fossil generation.
The consumption of
power in the United States is forecast to grow 17.3% from 2024 through 2034 which compares with only 5.2% over the prior
10-year
period from 2014 to 2024 according to the EIA and Wood Mackenzie. At the same
time, more than   % of the existing generation fleet in the United States is slated to be retired from 2025 through 2034 according to Wood Mackenzie. The combination of growing demand for power coupled with the large number of fossil
generation retirements has created increasing demand for new generation capacity. According to Wood Mackenzie, the average amount of new generation capacity constructed annually in the U.S. from 2025 to 2034 will grow    to
GW
ac
per year compared to the prior
10-year
period. Nearly  % of the new generation capacity built from 2025 to 2034 will
be solar and battery storage projects according to Wood Mackenzie. We believe increasing demand for power, fossil generation retirements and the large proportion of new generation that is expected to be solar and battery storage projects will result
in growing demand for our services.





•




Longstanding relationships with leading independent power producers, utilities and developers.
We strive
to build long-term relationships with large customers that make significant investments in new power plants every year. We generated all of our 2024 revenues from jobs for clients that were also clients during the past three years and the average
length of our relationship with our top 10 clients in 2024 was four years. Additionally, we have dedicated teams of technicians that are
co-located
at many of our clients’ facilities to assist with the
operation and maintenance of their power plants, further embedding us with our customers.





•




Economies of scale in O&M services.
Most preventative maintenance of solar and battery storage
projects is undertaken by technical service teams that travel from
site-to-site
on a route. The denser their route, measured by the number of projects in close proximity
to one another, the more revenue the service team will generate for each hour they work. We provide preventative maintenance services to 144 power plants which has allowed us to create optimized routes that maximize the revenue we generate from each
hour worked by our service employees.





•




Comprehensive risk management.
We have developed a comprehensive risk management system that is designed
to ensure our projects achieve their target margins. To ensure we accurately estimate project costs, we employ cross-functional teams that collaborate on each project to develop project-specific pricing and execution strategies. We validate our
pricing and
de-risk
our target margins by entering into one or more LNTP agreements with our customers. We seek to further manage our risk by including standard provisions in all our EPC contracts that limit
our risk, conducting rigorous reviews of all agreements and requiring senior management approval before contracts are signed. We monitor our performance against our targets through daily, weekly and monthly reviews of all projects by our senior
management team. We also routinely conduct independent reviews of operational projects for quality and safety.





•




Strong free cash flow generation.
We prioritize free cash flow generation. Elements of our business model
that allow us to generate strong free cash flow include our contract structure which requires our customers to make upfront deposits prior to us beginning work and incurring costs; payment terms that obligate our customers to make monthly progress
payments; modest capital expenditures as a percentage of our revenues; and a low level of debt which keeps our cash interest cost low. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we generated $117.6 million of net cash provided by operating
activities which was equivalent to 72.0% of our Adjusted EBITDA for the period.





•




Culture of innovation that prioritizes tech-enablement.
We believe that integrating technology with
business processes enhances efficiency, quality, predictability and customer experience. Over the past decade, we have developed several market-leading technology solutions, including Sunscreen, a proprietary



108





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.







software solution we developed to manage solar energy projects, and Vitals, our proprietary O&M analytics platform. Sunscreen allows project teams to track construction progress online,
offering clients near real-time status updates. Vitals detects and diagnoses asset-level issues in real-time, enabling customers to act quickly and maximize uptime. We believe we have also been at the forefront in process automation and optimization
through our internally developed data analytics platform; use of robotics in the field; aerial drones; and
AI-based
image processing.





•




Experienced management team with long tenures in the construction and power industries
. Our management
team has an average of more than 25 years of experience, including in high performing EPC and O&M services and power generation businesses. They are experts at managing large and diverse work forces to deliver generation projects
on-time
and
on-budget
while operating safely. We have a team-oriented culture and encourage candor from our employees, which we believe helps us to succeed and drive
operational excellence. We believe that operating with purpose, passion and creativity benefits our clients, stakeholders and employees as well as the communities where we operate.

Our Growth Strategy

We have developed a series of
interrelated strategies designed to maximize our growth potential, including:





•




Continuing to expand market share.
As solar energy projects grow larger and more complex, we believe large
EPCs, such as ourselves, are well-positioned to increase our share of the market. From 2014 to 2024, the average size of a planned solar energy project increased more than 5x from 20 MW
ac
to
112 MW
ac
according to the EIA. At the same time, there are fewer and fewer sites available that are flat, with soils that do not require drilling or specialized foundations, and close to a
substation with the capacity to interconnect new resources without upgrades. The greater financial requirements that come with larger projects coupled with increased scope of work required for more challenging sites is making it increasingly
difficult for smaller contractors to compete. Our average annual market share has increased from 10% in the 2012 to 2017 period to 14% in the 2018 to 2023 period according to data from Solar Power World. We believe the ratio of our next 12 months
backlog to our last 12 months reported revenues underscores our continuing market share growth.





•




Growing our revenues from existing infrastructure.
O&M services, including preventative and corrective
maintenance, equipment upgrades, storm damage work and repowering generate recurring and
re-occurring
revenues over the life of a project that typically carry higher margins than new construction. Our strategy
is to increase the share of our revenue that comes from O&M services by increasing the number of O&M customers that we have. We believe that by focusing on existing infrastructure in addition to new construction, we will be able to grow our
revenues faster than our competitors who focus only on new construction as well as reduce the impact of adverse changes in the amount or pace of new construction in any year on our financial results.





•




Expanding into new
end-markets.
We intend to apply our
know-how
and capabilities to new
end-markets
that are experiencing significant growth. We are currently evaluating the utility infrastructure and data center markets which we
believe may offer both attractive EPC and O&M opportunities. For example, on June 13, 2025, we acquired Spartan Infrastructure, a provider of T&D infrastructure services. Spartan Infrastructure expanded our capability to perform high voltage
work on substations and other utility infrastructure. With these expanded capabilities, we believe we will be able to generate additional revenues from T&D work related to solar and battery storage projects as well as compete for utility
projects related to the expansion, upgrading or replacement of grid infrastructure.





•




Leveraging innovation to improve efficiency and increase margins.
We plan to apply data analytics,
automation and robotics to streamline processes, reduce labor hours, optimize resource allocation and improve quality. For example, we recently made an investment into a company that is developing robots to perform certain maintenance functions that
currently require large teams of laborers. We also have a dedicated team focused on developing and piloting new methods, tools and equipment that reduce labor hours with the goal of increasing our margins and shortening construction timelines.



109

•




Continuing to invest in craft skilled labor.
We are a people business that depends on attracting and
retaining high quality employees to continue our growth. To ensure we can attract and develop the best employees, we are working with trade unions to develop apprenticeship programs for craftsman and technicians and with universities to create
internships for engineering students. In 2024, more than 300 apprentices and students gained
on-the-job
training experience and exposure to our company through our
apprenticeship and internship programs. These programs allow us to identify future talent early as well as expose prospective employees to what makes our company and culture attractive in a more comprehensive way than is possible through a
traditional recruiting process.





•




Making targeted acquisitions.
We believe that acquisitions can accelerate our growth by adding
capabilities that we do not currently have, creating access to new customers and expanding our geographic footprint. Our strategy is to acquire firms that offer complementary services to our own, operate in attractive markets where we do not
currently have a presence and have a track record of strong financial performance and safe operations.

Our Services

We provide a comprehensive suite of services for both new construction and existing infrastructure.

New Construction Services

Engineering.
We provide custom design and engineering services for new solar and battery storage projects and related T&D infrastructure,
including site layout, energy modeling,
sub-surface
risk analysis and electrical engineering. We specialize in value engineering and environmental compliance. Value engineering is the process of using
proprietary software tools, in combination with our significant construction and O&M expertise to optimize a project’s design for cost, constructability, performance and longevity. Environmental compliance is the process of ensuring that a
power plant will comply with all relevant environmental regulations during construction as well as over its operating life. We have licensed engineers on staff and typically provide our customers with
on-site

engineering support throughout project development to reduce the risk of environmental violations. We typically charge for engineering services as part of a larger lump sum EPC contract.

Procurement.
We typically procure most of the equipment and materials used in the projects we build, except for solar modules and batteries
which most of our customers purchase directly from vendors. Major materials categories we purchase, including piles, inverters, trackers and fixed racking systems, cabling, and electrical equipment often represents between 40% and 45% of the total
value of our EPC contracts. We offer procurement services, including advising our customers on the merits of various equipment suppliers, specifying the appropriate equipment for the site and desired capabilities, obtaining quotes from suppliers,
negotiating purchase terms and purchasing the equipment. We have established master purchase order agreements with key equipment suppliers with
pre-negotiated
terms that give us preferred pricing, secured
capacity and reduced lead times. We maintain relationships with both domestic and international suppliers and have more than three qualified suppliers for the major components we purchase. We also offer domestic equipment options for customers
seeking to qualify for domestic content bonus tax credits under the IRA. We typically charge for procurement services as part of a lump sum EPC contract.

Construction.
We provide comprehensive construction services for solar, battery storage and related T&D infrastructure projects that cover
the civil, mechanical and electrical scopes of work. The civil scope of work typically includes clearing and grading the site, creating drainage systems and installing foundations. The mechanical scope of work typically includes erecting the racking
systems and mounting solar panels. The electrical scope of work typically includes installing EBOS, inverters and batteries and interconnecting the various components. In contrast to many of our competitors, we typically self-perform all scopes of
work on our projects, and we manage project execution through a highly experienced group of regional managers and general superintendents. We charge for construction services on a lump sum basis.

Testing.
We offer a series of third-party tests on equipment to confirm it operates to the
standards included in the original equipment manufacturer’s warranty, utility testing requirements for power output are met and performance tests as stipulated in our contracts are validated. For T&D equipment, we offer NETA-compliant
acceptance testing to confirm that any transmission infrastructure meets national standards prior to operation. We typically charge for testing services on a time and materials basis.

Commissioning.
We offer extensive commissioning services that we believe are unique in our industry and differentiate us from our competitors.
Commissioning is the process of verifying that all individual components of the power plant have been optimized to operate together in a way that maximizes the power plant’s overall performance. Our dedicated commissioning teams and process
streamlines trouble-shooting and data integration so that power plants can meet or beat the deadlines for when power must be available for utility consumption. We typically charge for commissioning services on a time and materials basis.

Existing Infrastructure Services

Operations
& Maintenance.
We offer a wide range of O&M services, up to and including manning
customers’ sites with our personnel and operating their assets for them. Our operations services include managing and controlling the power plant, monitoring its performance, particularly for uptime and availability, and ensuring compliance
with safety and regulatory requirements. To facilitate our operations services, we install
end-to-end
SCADA and network infrastructure solutions during the construction
of a project that allow us to remotely monitor and control the site from our
24-7

state-of-the-art
Operations Control Center (“OCC”) in San Diego. As a NERC-registered medium impact facility, the OCC
is compliant with all applicable NERC CIP standards.

Our maintenance services include both preventative maintenance and corrective maintenance.
Preventative maintenance is the systematic care and upkeep necessary to ensure reliable performance of the power plant including component warranty preservation, routine equipment inspections, testing, vegetation management and panel cleaning,
monitoring system performance and addressing potential issues before they escalate. We typically charge fixed fees for preventative maintenance pursuant to contracts that typically have a minimum term of five years and renew automatically for
successive one year periods at the end of the initial term.

Corrective maintenance includes the repair or replacement of any major equipment or component
resulting from a malfunction, damage from weather and natural catastrophes, recalls, manufacturer recommendations or vandalism. We maintain dedicated teams to execute large-scale corrective repairs which allows our

on-site
technicians focused on the
day-to-day
operation and maintenance of the site. We charge for corrective maintenance on a
time and materials basis.

Repowering.
Owners often choose to upgrade or replace major equipment during the life of a power plant to improve
its productivity, upgrade the technology or extend its useful life. Our repowering services include replacing solar modules, inverters or trackers and battery augmentation. We believe lifecycle approach and significant labor and equipment resources
enables us to manage and execute large repowering projects more efficiently than
O&M-only
providers. We believe repowering activity will increase over time as available points of interconnection become
more and more scarce and improvements in technology increase the return on investment that can be achieved by replacing older equipment.

Sales & Marketing

We have a dedicated sales
team focused on building and maintaining close relationships with project developers, independent power producers and utilities that are building new solar and battery storage projects. We have an integrated sales team that brings together subject
matter experts and technical specialists across our new construction and existing infrastructure services teams. We market our lifecycle approach to all prospective customers and incentivize our sales team to sell both new construction and existing
infrastructure services. We strive to build long-term relationships with customers and consistently maintain dialogue on their upcoming



111

projects and future needs. Using data from our existing and prospective customers’ pipelines, we have built a proprietary database of over 250 GWs of projects that could begin construction
over the next five years to prioritize potential customers, facilitate bilateral negotiations and develop our sales goals. Our database is based on conversations with our customers who typically share their project pipelines with us, as well as
information generated using a software tool we developed to track all power projects in development.

We seek to increase awareness of our company and
capabilities through membership in industry organizations including the Solar Energy Industries Association (“SEIA”) and American Clean Power Association (“ACP”), as well as participation in key industry events including RE+,
Intersolar North America and Asset Management North America (“AMNA”). We also conduct targeted public relations efforts to drive brand awareness and educate customers on our capabilities.

Customers

Our customers include project developers,
independent power producers and utilities. For year ended December 31, 2024, our largest customer accounted for approximately 20% of our revenues, and our top ten largest customers accounted for over 90% of our revenues.

Customer Contracts

EPC Services
.
We
initially engage with customers by providing a preliminary estimate for the project based on a layout for the site, parameters for key equipment,
sub-surface
geotechnical analysis and other available
information about the project. If a customer accepts our estimate and awards us the project, we typically enter into an LNTP agreement pursuant to which the customer pays us for engineering and site investigation work, including in depth soil
and foundation pile testing, that allows us to further refine our estimate. We typically complete multiple LNTPs that include deposits on long-lead equipment and materials and early site mobilization, before we enter into a lump sum EPC
contract with our customer. LNTP agreements significantly reduce the risks for both us and our customers because they provide an opportunity to identify unforeseen risks or costs and incorporate them into our estimate before we commit to a
fixed price for the project.

Following completion of the LNTP agreements, we typically engage with customers for EPC services under lump sum
contracts that are executed over 12 to 18 months. Our lump sum contracts allocate responsibility for specific aspects of the work between the parties, such as permitting and procurement tasks, and establish project timelines, terms of the payment
process and risk allocation between SOLV and the customer for a fixed price. Our standard lump sum contracts establish our right to receive a change order from the customer should the actual conditions under which a project is built differ from the
anticipated conditions on which the contract was based, such as unexpected site conditions, adverse weather impacts or delays caused by the customer. When a project requires changes to the scope of services in a lump sum contract, we charge amounts
over and above the fixed price to compensate us for the change on either a fixed price or time and materials basis. We typically receive a mobilization payment from the customer when we begin work of between 3% to 5% of contract value, and we bill
customers monthly for our services on a percentage of completion basis for the remainder of the contract. Our LNTP agreements typically include similar terms but generally apply to stages of work occurring early in the project timeline, as described
above.

Our lump sum contracts include mutual insurance and indemnity obligations and generally contain liquidated damages provisions tied to a timeline
for completion of the project. Although claims of liquidated damages may occasionally be asserted in the normal course of business they are infrequently agreed to and paid by us. Our LNTP agreements generally do not include liquidated damages
provisions. We typically provide parent guarantees for our EPC contracts. In addition, some of our lump sum contracts require us to maintain surety bonds for the benefit of the customers during the construction. We maintain relationships with
multiple surety bonding providers and have not historically had any difficulties obtaining bonding for our projects.



112

O&M Services
.
We typically provide O&M services pursuant to contracts that
obligate the customer to pay us a fixed fee for operations and routine preventative maintenance and additional fees for corrective maintenance on a time and materials basis. Our O&M contracts typically have a minimum term of five years and renew
automatically for successive one year periods at the end of the initial term. If a customer terminates the contract prior to the end of the term, the customer typically must pay an early termination fee. Fees charged on a time and materials basis
are based on our cost plus a
mark-up
and are due upon completion of the work.

Our O&M contracts typically
contain an annual cap on liability set at the amount of the annual service fees, and include an availability guaranty, with exclusions for items outside of the operator’s control, such as periods of force majeure impact, utility curtailment or
scheduled maintenance. These contracts generally include an obligation to coordinate warranty maintenance as well as monthly and annual reporting requirements on performance, maintenance logs and incident tracking. Our O&M contracts also include
mutual insurance and indemnity obligations agreed to by both parties. Although claims of liquidated damages may occasionally be asserted under our O&M contracts in the normal course of business, they are infrequently agreed to and paid by us. We
may provide a parent guarantee for our O&M contracts.

Human Capital

Employees.
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 1,600 full-time employees. We have 21 active collective bargaining agreements
covering approximately 158 employees which are typically renewed every five years. We have not experienced and do not expect any significant grievances, strikes or work stoppages and believe our relations with employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements are good.

Retention and Training.
We are a people business that depends on attracting and retaining high quality
employees to continue our growth, enable for greater control over project timelines, improve execution quality and consistency and ensure a high level of safety. Our long-tenured regional managers and general superintendents are assigned to a
project in its early stages and stay with that project through its completion and are experts in the geographies and terrain where they work which we believe improves productivity and controls cost. Our scale improves our ability to develop our
employees to serve in roles across multiple services within our organization which increases retention and provides our employees more opportunities for development. We source craft employees locally through our extensive relationships with unions
and labor agencies in regions where we operate who comply with our exact hiring needs which often results in fully trained labor for our projects.

Safety.
We have established a comprehensive safety program throughout our operations designed to comply with our internal safety standards as
well as applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Our senior and operational leadership is fully engaged in protecting our workforce through a proactive program that prioritizes workforce training and third-party evaluation of our
processes to drive continuous improvement. Our total recordable incident rate per one hundred employees per year was 0.65 during 2024. Our lost-time incident rate per one hundred employees per year was 0.65 during 2024. These rates were 0.9% lower
than the most recently published U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ overall rates for our industry, respectively.

Tech-Enablement

We believe in using technology to increase the efficiency of our operations, lower our costs, improve the quality and safety of our work and enhance our
customer and employee experience. Key elements of tech-enablement that we currently employ in our businesses include:

Proprietary Software
Tools.
We have developed two proprietary software tools, Sunscreen and Vitals, that we use in our operations. Sunscreen is a project management platform that we use to manage the delivery of our EPC services. Sunscreen tracks construction
activities, captures daily work logs and inspections, maintains quality assurance and quality control checklists, SWPPP compliance and safety. We believe Sunscreen improves our productivity because it enables standardized data capture in the field
which we can use to improve our processes and procedures. Vitals is our web-based power plant performance monitoring and reporting platform



113

that allows our field services teams to assess system performance without slowing energy production. Our field service teams and operations center are integrated through Vitals, which allows us
to dispatch resources as needed for power plant corrective maintenance. Through Vitals, we have accumulated more than 50 terabytes of operating data across the power plants we monitor, which enables us to make data-driven improvements to our
construction methods and equipment selections, as well as gain insights into ways to improve uptime and increase energy generation for our customers.

Robotics.
We collaborate with industry-pioneering robotics companies to enhance the installation process. Over the last several years we have
been working with industry-pioneering robotics companies to observe and conduct trials of early stage human assist robotics, and our dedicated innovation team works closely with
on-site
project teams to plan
for, deploy and provide feedback on potential robotic solutions. Robotic solutions we have piloted include automated installation of solar modules, assisted erection of torque tube and racking systems, and GPS-guided and remotely operated equipment.
Together, these robotic solutions may help us to increase our installation capacity by reducing the labor required to install each MW of capacity, increasing our efficiency by saving time on installations, improving quality through automation and
creating safer work environments for our project teams.

AI-Driven
Data Analytics.
We are investing
in the evaluation and implementation of data-driven solutions that help optimize resources and deliver projects faster without the cost of new equipment or major process changes. Our pilots include
AI-powered

construction progress monitoring using industrial drones, O&M diagnostic chatbot utilizing field data and manufacturer information to identify equipment malfunctions and recommended standard operating procedures and workflow simulator to
increase install efficiency. We currently leverage a small number of mainstream third-party AI tools, primarily including Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT Enterprise, and are in early stages of working with third-party vendors and consultants to
further develop our AI strategy. We have not initiated the development of any proprietary AI technology.

Competition

For new construction services, we compete with both large, national companies that have significant financial and technical resources as well as with small,
regional companies. Some of our national competitors include Kiewit, MasTec, McCarthy, Mortenson, Quanta Services and Primoris Services.

For existing
infrastructure services, we compete with third-party providers of operations and maintenance services, including Act Power Services, NovaSource Power Services, Origis Energy Services, Pearce Services and QE Solar.

We believe our lifecycle approach of providing both EPC and O&M services gives us a competitive advantage over our larger competitors who only provide EPC
services, and our scale, expertise and financial resources give us a competitive advantage over our regional competitors.

Suppliers

Under our EPC contracts, we typically procure major categories of equipment for our customers’ power plants, including piles, trackers or fixed racking
systems, inverters, EBOS and medium and high-voltage equipment, which are generally available from domestic or foreign suppliers at competitive prices. We have strong relationships with all
tier-one
equipment
vendors, offering optionality and access to favorable terms and pricing. We work closely with our suppliers to drive product enhancements that improve efficiency during construction and increase power plant performance. Import tariffs on materials
and components we procure internationally are generally passed through to our customers pursuant to change of law provisions in our contracts that provide for a contract price adjustment for changes in import duties. We also have a domestic sourcing
strategy and relationships that enable us to offer fully domestically procured projects whenever necessary or preferred by our customers. We are not overly dependent on any single vendor or supplier of technologies or products and have multiple
suppliers in key categories across the business.

Seasonality

The construction industry is subject to seasonal variations. Demand for new construction and repowering is generally lower during the winter months due to
reduced construction activity during inclement weather. Our revenues are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity.

Facilities & Equipment

Our corporate
headquarters are located in San Diego, CA. We currently operate out of 15 regional office locations including our San Diego office, all of which are leased. Our OCC is located in our San Diego headquarters and is staffed
24-7
and complies with all NERC CIP standards. We are currently implementing a
back-up
control center in our Bend, OR facility that can be operated remotely. We believe that
our existing facilities are adequate for our current requirements and that comparable or alternative space is readily available to accommodate our operations.

We depend on the availability of a wide range of construction and maintenance equipment to perform our services and operate a fleet of owned and leased
equipment. As of December 31, 2024, our fleet consisted of over 850 vehicles and trucks and more than 200 pieces of earthmoving and heavy equipment. We leverage technology and software to measure the utilization of our fleet and monitor it for
maintenance and repairs with the goal of maximizing our efficiency and minimizing downtime.

Insurance & Risk Management

We maintain a comprehensive schedule of insurance policies covering a broad range of exposures arising from our construction and general business operations,
which require the use of heavy equipment and exposure to inherently hazardous conditions. We maintain insurance policies for, among other things, employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability, aviation, cyber, financial and
general liability claims. We manage and maintain a portion of our risk through retentions and/or high deductibles. As a supplement to our high-deductible primary insurance, we maintain insurance with excess insurance carriers for potential losses
that exceed the amount of our deductible obligations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. For additional information regarding our insurance and
the risks associated with insurance coverage, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating Our Business—Insurance and claims expenses, as well as the unavailability or cancelation of third-party insurance coverage, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Physical risks associated with climate change have also
increased hazards associated with our operations, which in turn has increased the potential for liability and increased the costs associated with our operations. For example, severe weather events such as extreme cold weather, hail, hurricanes,
heavy snowfall, fires and floods could result in a delay of our operations and could cause severe damage to equipment used in our projects and/or our customers’ assets. In addition, the risk of wildfires in some of the areas where we operate
has exposed us and other contractors and O&M service providers to increased risk of liability in connection with our operations in those locations, as these events can be started by electrical power and other infrastructure on which we have
performed services. Given the potentially significant liabilities associated with any of these events, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, these climate conditions
could also result in increased costs for third-party insurance and reduce the amount insurance carriers are willing to make available to us under such policies. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating Our Business— Our business
and results of operations are subject to physical risks associated with climate change.”

We believe that we are in compliance with all material licensing and regulatory requirements that are necessary to conduct our
operations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of certain of our operating licenses, as well as give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from
future bidding opportunities.

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including
the handling, transportation and disposal of
non-hazardous
and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and other discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water,
groundwater and soil. We are also subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. We could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain
environmental laws and regulations or be subject to revocation of certain licenses or permits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a result, from time to time, we incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs and obligations to remain in compliance with applicable environmental laws
and regulations, to correct environmental noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to our projects. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with our environmental obligations.

We or our customers benefit from certain government subsidies and economic incentives from time to time, including renewable energy tax credits, rebates and
other incentives that support the development and adoption of clean energy. For example, the IRA introduced and extended a number of federal tax credits to promote clean energy development that has accelerated investments in clean energy since its
enactment, thereby increasing demand from our customers for our services.

While these government incentives may benefit our business, certain adverse
actions, interpretations or determinations of new or existing laws or regulations could have a negative impact on our business. For example, some of the guidance and rulemaking enacted under the prior presidential administration could be changed or
modified by the current presidential administration, creating uncertainty with respect to implementation of the IRA and its tax incentive provisions, as well as other federal government policy that has historically been favorable to clean energy and
energy storage in the United States. It remains uncertain whether Congress will modify or repeal the IRA in connection with the budget reconciliation process or otherwise. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our projects will be eligible for
tax credits or other benefits under the IRA, or that any modification or repeal of the IRA would not have a material effect on our business. “See Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Compliance—The unavailability, reduction or
elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Further, in recent years, certain of our projects and certain customer spending in our industry has been negatively impacted by regulatory and permitting
delays. Any tariffs, duties, taxes, assessments, or other limitations on the availability or sourcing of materials, equipment or components for our customers’ projects can also increase costs

for customers and create variability of project timing. For example, regulatory, legislative or executive action with respect to regional and global trade relationships have impacted, and may
impact in the future, the supply chain for certain critical components required for our customers’ projects (e.g., transformers, breakers and other key electrical components) and costs associated therewith. For further information regarding the
effects of regulation on our business, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulation and Compliance.”

Conversely, we believe that there
are also several existing, pending or proposed legislative or regulatory actions that may alleviate certain regulatory and permitting issues and positively impact long-term demand, particularly in connection with solar power and renewable energy
projects. For example, regulatory changes aimed at reducing lengthy permitting processes could potentially result in accelerated project approvals, and an increase in focus on domestic energy production could create additional incentives for solar
power and renewable energy projects. Additionally, certain legislation, such as the IRA and the IIJA, as well as other policy and economic incentives and overall public sentiment, are designed to support and encourage solar power and renewable
energy projects that can potentially increase demand for our services over the long term.

Legal Proceedings

We are not currently a party to any actions the outcome of which would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations if determined adversely to us. From time to time, we may be subject to various claims, lawsuits and other legal and administrative proceedings that may arise in the ordinary course of business. Some of
these claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may range in complexity and result in substantial uncertainty; it is possible that they may result in damages, fines, penalties,
non-monetary
sanctions or relief.

Controlled Company
Exception

After the closing of this offering, American Securities will have more than 50% of the combined voting power of our common stock, including
in the election of directors. As a result, we will be a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the



rules and may elect not to comply with certain
corporate governance standards, including that: (i) a majority of our board of directors consists of “independent directors,” as defined under the



rules; (ii) we have a nominating
and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and (iii) we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. Therefore, immediately following the closing of this offering,
we may not have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, an entirely independent nominating and corporate governance committee, or an entirely independent compensation committee unless and until such time as we are required to
do so. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of these corporate governance requirements. In the event that we cease to be a “controlled company” and our shares
continue to be listed on the



, we will be required to comply with these provisions within the applicable transition periods. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of
Our Class A Common Stock—Following the offering, we will qualify as a “controlled company,” as defined in the



listing rules, and, as a result, we will qualify for, and may rely on,
exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. In addition, our Sponsor’s interests may conflict with our interests
and the interests of other stockholders.”

Board Composition

Our business and affairs will be managed under the direction of our board of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide
that, subject to the rights of the holders of preferred stock, the number of directors on our board of directors shall be fixed exclusively by resolution adopted by our board of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
our amended and restated bylaws will provide that our board of directors will be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the directors in each class serving for a three-year term, and one class being elected each year
by our stockholders. Our directors will be divided among the three classes as follows:





•




the Class I directors will be     and     and their terms will expire at
the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2026;



120

•




the Class II directors will be    ,     and     and
their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2027; and





•




the Class III directors will be    ,     and    , and
their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2028.

Any increase or decrease in the number of directors
will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist
of one-third of
the directors. This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of
delaying or preventing changes in control of the Company. See “Description of Capital Stock—Anti-Takeover Provisions.”

Director
Independence

Our board of directors has affirmatively determined that    ,    ,    ,
and     are each an “independent director,” as defined under the     rules. In making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships
that each director has with the Company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining his or her independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each director, and the
transactions involving them described in the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

Board Committees


Our board of directors directs the management of our business and affairs, as provided by Delaware law, and conducts its business through actions of
the board of directors and standing committees. Our board of directors has established three standing committees—audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance—each of which operates under a charter that will be approved by
our board of directors. Substantially concurrently with the consummation of this offering, each committee’s charter will be available on our principal corporate website at www.solvenergy.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through,
any of our websites is not, and will not be deemed to be, incorporated in this prospectus or to be part of this prospectus.

Audit Committee


The primary purposes of our audit committee under the committee’s charter will be to assist the our board of directors with oversight of,
among other things:





•




our accounting and financial reporting processes;





•




audits and integrity of our financial statements;





•




the qualifications, engagement, compensation, independence and performance of our independent registered public
accounting firm; and





•




our process relating to risk management and the conduct and systems of internal control over financial reporting
and disclosure controls and procedures.

The members of our audit committee will be



,





and



.



will serve as the chairperson of the committee. All members of our audit committee meet
the requirements for financial literacy under the applicable rules. Our board of directors has determined that each of



,



and

10A-3
under the Exchange Act and the applicable




rules.
Our board of directors has determined that




is an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by applicable SEC rules and has the requisite financial sophistication as defined under

Risk Oversight

Risk assessment and oversight are an integral part of our governance and management processes. Our board of directors encourages management to promote a
culture that incorporates risk management into our corporate strategy and
day-to-day
business operations. Our board of directors does not have a standing risk management
committee, but rather administers this oversight function directly through our board of directors as a whole, as well as through various standing committees of our board of directors that address risks inherent in their respective areas of
oversight.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

None of the expected members of our compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of the Company. None of our executive officers currently
serves, or has served during the last year, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as the expected member(s) of our board of directors or compensation committee.
See the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions” for information about related party transactions involving members of our compensation committee or their affiliates.

EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

The purpose of this
Compensation Discussion and Analysis section (the “CD&A”) is to provide a description of our compensation programs for our executive officers. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans,
considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. Actual compensation programs that we adopt following this offering may differ materially from the currently planned programs summarized in this discussion
.



This discussion focuses on our Chief Executive Officer, our former Chief Financial Officer, who served until January 27, 2025, and our three
most highly compensated executive officers (the “NEOs”) during 2024, who were:





•




George Hershman, our Chief Executive Officer;





•




Benjamin Catalano, our former Chief Financial Officer;





•




Kevin Deters, our Chief Operating Officer;





•




David Grubb Jr., our Chief Commercial Officer; and





•




Erik Johnson, our Chief Strategy Officer.

Mr. Chad Plotkin was appointed to serve as our Chief Financial Officer on January 27, 2025, but Mr. Plotkin’s compensation is not included
in this CD&A since he was not an NEO during 2024.

Our Compensation Philosophy and Objectives

Our compensation approach is tied to our stage of development. As our executive compensation program evolves as a public company, we expect that it will
reflect the belief that the total amount earned by our executives will depend on achieving performance objectives designed to enhance stockholder value. We intend to continue to evaluate and possibly make changes to our executive compensation
programs with the goal of aligning our programs with our executive compensation philosophy as a public company. Accordingly, the compensation paid to our NEOs for 2024, and the form and manner in which it was paid, is not necessarily indicative of
how we will compensate our NEOs after this offering. Prior to this offering, we were a privately-held company. As a result, we have not been subject to any stock exchange listing or SEC rules related to the board of directors and compensation
committee structure and function.

In setting and overseeing the compensation of our executive officers, our compensation programs are currently designed
to achieve the following specific objectives:





•




Position our target total direct compensation – comprised of base salary and target annual incentive bonus
opportunity – at a level at which we can successfully attract, retain and motivate executives with the talent and capabilities critical to executing our business strategy and creating long-term value;





•




Reinforce our
pay-for-performance

philosophy with compensation based on annual and multi-year financial and operational objectives; and





•




Align the interests of executives with those of equity holders, particularly with respect to key executive
officers who are best positioned to drive long-term value creation.

Our executive compensation program is continually evaluated for
effectiveness in achieving these objectives as well as to reflect the economic environment within which we operate.

Determination of Compensation

The Role of Compensation Committee of the Board of Managers

Our compensation programs for our executive officers have historically been overseen by the compensation committee of our current private company board of
managers, which has made decisions regarding the compensation for our NEOs, after taking into account recommendations from management, as further described below. Following this offering, the compensation committee of our public company board of
directors will be responsible for overseeing our executive compensation programs as well as compensation decisions regarding our executive officers.

The
compensation decisions of our compensation committee with respect to our executive officers’ salaries and incentives are influenced by the executive’s level of responsibility and function, our overall performance and profitability and the
assessment of the competitive marketplace (as determined based on our compensation committee members’ business experience). Our compensation committee also takes into account each executive officer’s tenure and individual performance, our
overall annual budget and changes in the cost of living.

The Role of Management

Our Chief Executive Officer provides input regarding the duties and responsibilities of his direct reports and the results of his evaluations of their annual
performance. Management also recommends to the current compensation committee certain aspects of executive compensation program design, including appropriate financial and
non-financial
performance goals for
use in our incentive plans and additional business and function specific performance goals for executives.

Compensation Consultant

Following this offering, we expect to engage a compensation consult to provide executive compensation consulting services to help align executive pay with
market practices.

Primary Components of our Executive Compensation Program

In 2024, our executive compensation consisted of several compensation elements, as described in the table below:




Component




What the Component Rewards




Purpose of the Component

Base Salary



Core competence of the executive relative to skills, experience and contributions to us.



Provides fixed compensation based on competitive market practice.

Annual Cash Incentive



Contributions toward our achievement of specified financial targets and other key performance criteria.



Provides focus on meeting annual goals that lead to our short- and long-term success.

Equity Awards



Appreciation in the value of our equity based on time and performance vested awards.



Provides retention benefits and rewards executives through achievement of performance goals.

Retirement Benefits



Participation in our 401(k) plan incentivizes employee retirement savings and continued service.



Provides attractive
tax-deferred
retirement savings vehicles for eligible executives and promotes retention of our executives over a longer-term time
horizon.



125

Component




What the Component Rewards




Purpose of the Component

Welfare Benefits



Executives participate in employee benefit plans generally available to our employees, including medical, health, life insurance and disability plans.



These benefits are part of our broad-based total compensation program.

Additional Benefits and Perquisites



Certain NEOs are provided with a vehicle allowance and unlimited vacation balance.



Consistent with offering our executives a competitive compensation program.

Termination Benefits



Certain NEOs are parties to employment agreements that provide them with certain severance benefits.



These arrangements reward executives for their continued service and subject them to restrictive covenants that protect our interests. Termination benefits are designed to retain executives and provide security for our NEOs so their
focus remains on driving our performance.


We have no set policy for allocating pay between the various components of compensation and instead evaluate our executive
officers’ compensation opportunities on a
case-by-case
basis after taking into account the factors described above. To achieve competitive positioning for the
annual cash compensation component of our executive compensation program, our compensation committee sets base salaries at a level it believes to be competitive and also places emphasis on annual bonus opportunities because they are more directly
linked to our performance. As such, our compensation is focused on fixed pay and performance-based opportunities, while still intending to remain competitive overall. Targeted annual cash bonus opportunities are based on our budgeted financial goals
and other factors, which may fluctuate from year to year.

Base Salary

Each NEO’s base salary level was established prior to 2024 and reflected the terms of their employment agreement or the determination of the compensation
committee and was based on a combination of factors, including the executive’s experience and tenure, the executive’s individual performance, our budgeted performance, market factors and changes in responsibility. Our compensation
committee does not target base salary at any particular percent of total compensation. Our compensation committee reviews salary levels annually based on these factors and takes into account salary recommendations made by our Chief Executive Officer
and other senior members of management.

Our NEO’s 2024
year-end
base salaries were as follows:
Mr. Hershman $500,000, Mr. Catalano $360,000, Mr. Deters $400,000, Mr. Johnson $360,000 and Mr. Grubb $353,543. In 2025, our compensation committee approved an increase in Mr. Hershman’s base salary for 2025 to
$600,000. None of our other NEOs received increases to their base salaries in 2025.

Annual Cash Incentive Plan (ACIP)

Generally, we do not grant discretionary cash bonuses. However, from time to time, we may determine to grant
one-off

cash bonuses in connection with new hires. Upon commencement of employment in 2024, Mr. Deters was awarded a cash bonus of $275,000.

Our
compensation committee, after taking into account recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer and other senior members of management, considers a combination of the factors used to set the NEO’s base salary in establishing the annual
target bonus opportunities for our NEOs, which vary from year to year, and are governed by the terms of the plan. EBITDA is the primary factor considered for target bonus opportunities for our NEOs. These target bonus opportunities are set annually
when our board of managers sets our annual budget.



126

EBITDA is a
non-GAAP
financial measure that refers to our earnings before interest and other financing expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization. An
executive’s target bonus opportunity is a percentage of the executive’s base salary as described below.

No bonus incentive is earned if actual
performance falls below 75% on the EBITDA goal. The bonus incentive earned increases on a pro rata basis for actual performance between 75% and 100% of the EBITDA goal. Above 100% of the EBITDA goal, the bonus incentive earned increases on a pro
rata basis to a maximum of 150% at 125% of EBITDA.

The following table summarizes our annual incentive compensation targets for our NEOs for 2024:

The
target for EBITDA in 2024 was $138 million. We achieved $196.7 million or 142.5% of EBITDA and annual bonuses were paid as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table below.

Pre-Offering
Equity-Based Compensation

We view equity-based compensation as an important component of our balanced total compensation program. Equity-based compensation creates an ownership culture
among our employees that provides an incentive to contribute to the continued growth and development of our business and aligns interest of executives with those of our stockholders. We have historically not granted equity awards on an annual basis,
and instead have granted equity awards periodically at levels designed to encourage retention over the vesting period. Prior to this offering, we historically granted Class C Units in SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP (the “Partnership”)
either directly to the participant if the participant was not an employee or to SOLV Energy Management Holdings LP, which then granted units to our employees that track the Class C Units (the Class C Units of the Partnership or the
tracking units granted by SOLV Energy Management Holdings LP, as applicable, shall be referred to as “Class C Units”). The Class C Units were generally sized to incentivize employees for a number of years following the date of
grant. The Class C Units are intended to constitute “profits interests” for U.S. federal income tax purposes that are intended to allow the holders to participate in the increase in value of the Partnership from and after the date of
grant of such interests. The Class C Units were granted with a “hurdle amount,” which acted similarly to a strike price for a stock option such that the holder would only realize value in excess of such amount.

50% of each grant of the Class C Units are generally subject to time-based vesting (the “Time Units”) and 50% of each grant of the Class C
Units are generally subject to performance-based vesting (the “Performance Units”). The Time Units vested over five years with 20% of the Time Units eligible to vest on each of the first five anniversaries of the vesting start date, with
full acceleration upon a Transaction (as defined below), subject to continued service of the grantee on each applicable vesting date. The performance-based component is satisfied based on achievement of annual EBITDA targets over five years, subject
to full acceleration upon a Transaction, in all cases subject to continued service on the vesting date. If the EBITDA target for a given year was not achieved but then the cumulative EBITDA target for a later year was achieved, the previously
unvested Performance Units would vest. The performance component was also deemed satisfied on the eighth anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued service of the grantee on such date, if the EBITDA targets were not

previously achieved. Vesting of certain of the Time Units and Performance Units was also conditioned upon the attainment of a specified
multiple-of-invested capital
return for the Class A Units of the Partnership. Our compensation committee and board of managers have implemented alternative vesting schedules from time to time,
including certain awards of Class C Units that were only subject to time-based vesting over a five year period. Generally all unvested Class C Units are forfeited upon a termination of service and vested Class C Units are forfeited
upon a termination of service for cause.

A “Transaction” is generally defined to mean a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership, a sale of units of Partnership by certain entities and funds affiliated with American Securities (“AS Persons”), which results in AS Persons owning less than 50% of the outstanding equity interests, or any merger or
consolidation of Partnership, which results in AS Persons owning less than the majority of the voting power of the Partnership.

Certain service providers
participate in the SOLV Energy, LLC Restricted Unit Appreciation Plan, a phantom award plan pursuant to which participants are eligible to receive a cash payment based on the value of a Class A Unit of the Partnership upon the earlier of
(i) the consummation of a Transaction and (ii) December 23, 2026. The phantom awards are all fully vested.

Please refer to the Outstanding
Equity Awards at 2024 Year End table below for additional information regarding the equity awards issued to our NEOs.

The treatment of the Class C
Units will be determined prior to the completion of this offering.

Post-Offering Equity Awards

In connection with this offering, we intend to adopt a new equity incentive plan (the “2025 Incentive Plan”) in order to facilitate the grant of cash
and equity incentives to directors, employees (including our NEOs) and consultants of our company and certain of its affiliates and to enable our company and certain of its affiliates to obtain and retain services of these individuals, which is
essential to our long-term success. The 2025 Incentive Plan will be intended to provide flexibility to motivate, attract and retain employees who are expected to make significant contributions to our success and allow participants to share in such
success.

Other Benefits and Perquisites

We
provide the following benefits to our NEOs on the same basis as other employees:





•




Group medical, dental and vision benefits;





•




Life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance;





•




Short-term and long-term disability insurance;





•




401(k) Plans; and





•




Vacation, paid holidays and personal leave days.

In addition, we provide severance protection to certain of our NEOs pursuant to their employment agreements to the extent they have one and certain limited
termination-related protections in their equity award agreements. We also provide vehicle allowances to certain of our NEOs. Our board of managers believes that the costs of providing these perquisites and benefits are reasonable relative to their
value to our NEOs. These perquisites are designed to support a market-based total compensation package, which serves our talent attraction and retention objectives. We do not gross up any benefits or perquisites for taxes; executive officers bear
that cost.

Retirement Plans

Our NEOs
participate along with certain of our other employees and executives in our 401(k) plan. Under our 401(k) plan, we make a matching contribution to certain employees equal to 100% of a participant’s elective



128





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



deferral contributions up to 3%, and 50% of a participant’s elective deferral contributions of the next 2% of the participant’s pay that vests immediately.

We believe that our retirement programs serve as an important tool to attract and retain our NEOs and other key employees. We also believe that offering a
baseline of stable retirement benefits encourages our NEOs to make a long-term commitment to us. We do not adjust the level of retirement benefits based on the value of a NEO’s long-term incentive awards nor do we adjust the level of a
NEO’s total direct compensation for a given year in light of the value of retirement benefits.

Employment Agreement with our Chief Executive
Officer

We have entered into an employment agreement pursuant to which Mr. Hershman serves as our chief executive officer and president (the
“Hershman Employment Agreement”). In addition to base salary, the Hershman Employment Agreement entitles Mr. Hershman to an annual cash target bonus opportunity of 200% of his annual base salary. Mr. Hershman is entitled to
reimbursement of all reasonable business expenses incurred in the ordinary course of his duties that are consistent with our policies on travel, entertainment and other business expenses.

If Mr. Hershman is terminated by us without “cause” or for “good reason” (in each case, as defined in the Hershman Employment
Agreement), then, subject to his continued compliance with restrictive covenants to which he is subject, his timely execution and
non-revocation
of a release of claims in our favor and subject to certain
exceptions, during the severance period, he is entitled to receive severance payments and benefits consisting of (i) the sum of (A) 12 months of base salary and (B) target annual bonus; (ii) a pro rata portion of the bonus
Mr. Hershman would have earned for the year of termination (based on actual performance for such year and provided that the termination date occurs on or after the first day of the third quarter of the fiscal year) (“Pro Rata Bonus”);
(iii) up to 18 months of continued participation in our group health plan paid for by us in full for 12 months and with premiums for the last 6 months paid by Mr. Hershman as if he was an active employee and (iv) any earned but unpaid
bonus for any completed bonus year prior to termination (“Prior Year Bonus”).

In the event of Mr. Hershman’s death, he is entitled to
receive the Pro Rata Bonus and Prior Year Bonus as well as any insurance benefits payable under any benefit plans (other than any life insurance owned by us, such as
key-man
life insurance).

In the event of Mr. Hershman’s disability, he is entitled to receive, subject to the execution of a release of claims in our favor, the payments and
benefits due upon death as well as 12 months of base salary continuation.

The Hershman Employment Agreement also contains

non-disparagement
and
non-solicitation
and
non-hire
of employee restrictions for 24 months post-termination, as well as perpetual
confidentiality restrictions and provisions related to intellectual property protection.

There are currently no other employment agreements with any of
the other NEOs.

Severance Agreements

We are party
to severance agreements with certain NEOs and our current Chief Financial Officer, which provide for severance benefits and payments upon qualifying terminations without cause or resignations for good reason. A summary of the material terms of these
severance agreements are set forth below.

We have entered into severance agreements with Messrs. Grubb, Catalano and Plotkin, pursuant to which each is
entitled to certain severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination (collectively, the “Severance Agreements”). If Messrs. Grubb, Catalano or Plotkin are terminated by us without “cause” or for “good
reason” (as defined in the Severance Agreements), then, subject to continued compliance in all material respects with



129





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



restrictive covenants to which they are bound and

the timely execution and
non-revocation
of a release of claims in our favor, the Severance
Agreements provide severance payments and benefits

consisting of (i) 12 months continuation of base salary; (ii) a pro rata portion of the bonus each would have earned for the year of termination (based on actual

performance for
such year), provided that the termination date occurs on or after the first day of the third quarter of the fiscal year; (iii) up to 18 months of continued participation in our group health plan paid for by us in full for 12 months and with
premiums for the last 6 months to be paid by Messrs. Grubb, Catalano or Plotkin as if they were active employees; and (iv) any earned but unpaid bonus for any completed bonus year prior to termination.

Pursuant to the Severance Agreements, within 20 days following the termination of Messrs. Grubb, Catalano or Plotkin, we may determine to release them from
any restrictive covenant obligations to which they are bound and terminate all severance payments and benefits.

In addition, Messrs. Grubb and Catalano
are individually party to restrictive covenant agreements that contain
non-disparagement
and
non-solicitation
restrictions (collectively, the “Restrictive Activity
Agreements”). Pursuant to the Restrictive Activity Agreements, Messrs. Grubb and Mr. Catalano have agreed to refrain from making or publishing disparaging statements against us for five years post-termination and from soliciting our
employees for two years post-termination.

Tax and Accounting Considerations

Tax Considerations

We consider the tax (individual and
corporate) consequences of our executive compensation plans when designing the plans. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which will be applicable to us after this offering, limits tax deduction of compensation paid in excess of
$1,000,000 per year to NEOs.

Accounting Considerations

We also consider the stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards to executive officers as part of the expense associated with our overall
equity compensation program. We will monitor this expense as we develop our plans and strive to maintain a program that balances the goals of our equity program with the associated expense of the program.

Recovery of Erroneously Award Compensation

As
required by the     listing standards, we will adopt a policy that requires, subject to certain limited exceptions, the recoupment of erroneously awarded incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement
resulting from material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws. In such an event, we will seek to recover the amount of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation received by current and
former executive officers during the three-year fiscal year period prior to the date we are required to prepare an accounting restatement that was in excess of the amount that would have been awarded based on the related financial results, subject
to and in accordance with the terms of the policy and applicable law.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control

As discussed above under “—Employment Agreement with our Chief Executive Officer” and “—Severance Agreements,” the Hershman
Employment Agreement and the Severance Agreements provide for certain severance payments in connection with Messrs. Hershman, Grubb and Catalano’s respective terminations under certain circumstances. Additionally, each of the NEOs’
Class C Unit award agreements provide for the acceleration of vesting of all Class C Units upon the consummation of a “Transaction,” subject to the NEO’s continued employment through such Transaction; provided, that the
acceleration of vesting of certain Class C Units is also conditioned upon the achievement of a specified return on invested capital for certain holders of Class A Units of the Partnership. A “Transaction” has the meaning
described above under
“—Pre-Offering
Equity-Based Compensation.”



Potential Payment Summary

The table below
reflects the amount of compensation payable to our NEOs in the event of termination of the executive’s employment for various reasons or a termination following a change in control. The table does not

include amounts payable that would be made to NEOs under benefit plans or employment terms generally available to other salaried employees, such as group life or disability insurance, accrued but
unpaid salary or payments under our annual incentive plan, which are earned if the NEO works through the end of the relevant year. In the event of the death or disability of a NEO, the NEO will receive benefits under our disability plan or payments
under our life insurance plan, as applicable; provided, that Mr. Hershman will also receive the benefits set forth above under “—Employment Agreement with our Chief Executive Officer.” The payments under our disability plan and
life insurance plan are generally available to all employees and are therefore not included in the below table. Other than with respect to the Class C Units described above, we do not provide our NEOs with other payments that are payable on a
change in control. The amounts shown assume that a termination of employment and/or a change in control occurred on December 31, 2024.

PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS

The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock
(i) immediately following the consummation of the Transactions (excluding this offering), as described in “Our Organizational Structure” and (ii) as adjusted to give effect to this offering, for:





•




each person known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our Class A common stock or our Class B
common stock;





•




each of our directors;





•




each of our named executive officers; and





•




all of our executive officers and directors as a group.

As described in “Our Organizational Structure” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” each common unit of SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC (other than LLC Interests held by us) is redeemable from time to time at each holder’s option for, at our election, newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a
one-for-one
basis or a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each LLC Interest so redeemed, in each case, in accordance with the terms of
the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement; provided that, at our election, we may effect a direct exchange by SOLV Energy, Inc. of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such LLC Interests. The Continuing Equity Owners may,
subject to certain exceptions, exercise such redemption right for as long as their LLC Interests remain outstanding. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreements.” In connection with
this offering, we will issue to each Continuing Equity Owner, for nominal consideration, one share of Class B common stock for each common unit of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC such Continuing Equity Owner will own, respectively. As a result, the
number of shares of Class B common stock listed in the table below correlates to the number of LLC Interests American Securities and certain other principal stockholders will beneficially own immediately after the Transactions. Although the
number of shares of Class A common stock being offered hereby to the public and the total number of LLC Interests outstanding after the offering will remain fixed regardless of the initial public offering price in this offering, the shares of
Class B common stock held by the beneficial owners set forth in the table below after the consummation of the Transactions will vary, depending on the initial public offering price in this offering. The table below assumes the shares of
Class A common stock are offered at $


per share (the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus). See “Our Organizational Structure.”

The number of shares beneficially owned by each stockholder as described in this prospectus is determined under rules issued by the SEC. Under these rules,
beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which the individual or entity has sole or shared voting power or investment power. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by an individual or entity and the percentage ownership of that
person, shares of common stock subject to options, or other rights, including the redemption right described above with respect to each common unit, held by such person that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days of the
date of this prospectus, are considered outstanding, although these shares are not considered outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. The percentage ownership of each individual or entity after giving
effect to the Transactions and before this offering is computed on the basis of




shares of our Class A common stock outstanding and





shares of our Class B common stock outstanding. The percentage ownership of each individual or entity after the Transactions is computed on the basis of




shares of our Class A common
stock outstanding and




shares of our Class B common stock outstanding. The following tables do not give effect to the issuance of any equity-based compensation that we expect to be granted
to certain directors, officers and other employees in connection with this offering (based on an assumed initial public offering price of $


per share). Unless otherwise indicated, the address of all listed
stockholders is 16680 West Bernardo Drive, San Diego, CA 92127.

Each of the stockholders listed has sole voting and investment power with respect to the
shares beneficially owned by the stockholder unless noted otherwise, subject to community property laws where applicable.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The following are summaries of certain provisions of our related party agreements and are qualified in their entirety by reference to all of the provisions of
such agreements. Because these descriptions are only summaries of the applicable agreements, they do not necessarily contain all of the information that you may find useful. We, therefore, urge you to review the agreements in their entirety. Copies
of the forms of the agreements have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, and are available electronically on the website of the SEC at
www.sec.gov
.

The Transactions

In connection with the Transactions, we
will engage in certain transactions with our Sponsor, certain of our directors, executive officers and other persons and entities which are or will become holders of 5% or more of our voting securities upon the consummation of the Transactions.
These transactions will be described in “Our Organizational Structure” in a subsequent filing.

We intend to use the net proceeds that we
receive from this offering (including from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) to purchase



LLC Interests from SOLV Energy
Holdings LLC at a price per LLC Interest equal to the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock, less the underwriting discounts and commissions.

We intend to cause SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to use the net proceeds it receives from us in connection with this offering for general corporate purposes, which
could include the repayment of certain indebtedness, and growth initiatives, including potential merger and acquisition opportunities.

Tax Receivable
Agreement

We will enter into a Tax Receivable Agreement that will obligate us to make certain payments to the TRA Participants, which will be

The Limited Liability Company Agreement of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, dated as of August 26, 2021, governs the business operations of SOLV Energy Holdings

consummation of this offering will be fully paid and
non-assessable.
We are issuing




shares of Class B common stock to the Continuing Equity Owners
in connection with the Transactions.

The following summary describes the material provisions of our capital stock. Because this is only a summary, it
does not contain all the information that may be important to you. We urge you to read our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which
this prospectus forms a part.

Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws summarized
below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for
the shares of common stock.

Common Stock

Class A common stock

Holders of shares of our
Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders.

one-to-one
ratio between the number of LLC Interests held by the Continuing Equity Owners and the number of shares of Class B common stock issued to the Continuing Equity

Holders of shares of our
Class B common stock will vote together with holders of our Class A common stock as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except for certain amendments to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation described below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

other than matters relating to the election of directors must be approved by a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and voting on the subject matter.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



Under the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is
authorized to direct us to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our board of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights,
dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock.

The purpose of authorizing our
board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with
possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting
stock. Additionally, the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock by restricting dividends on the Class A common stock, diluting the voting power of the Class A common stock or
subordinating the liquidation rights of the Class A common stock. As a result of these or other factors, the issuance of preferred stock could have an adverse impact on the market price of our Class A common stock.

Registration Rights

We intend to enter into a
Registration Rights Agreement with certain of the Continuing Equity Owners in connection with this offering pursuant to which such parties will have specified rights to require us to register all or a portion of their shares under the Securities
Act. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Registration Rights Agreement.”

Forum Selection

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide (i) (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company,
(b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (c) any action asserting a
claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended or restated) or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be exclusively brought in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware or, if such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction thereof, the federal district court of the State of Delaware; and (ii) the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the
resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision shall not apply to claims seeking to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.


To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any shares of our capital stock
shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In any case, stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the
rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of
provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will also provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have
notice of and consented to this choice of forum provision. These exclusive forum provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.

Dividends

The DGCL permits a corporation to declare and
pay dividends out of “surplus” or, if there is no “surplus,” out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. “Surplus” is



147





Table of Contents

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



defined as the excess of the net assets of the corporation over the amount determined to be the capital of the corporation by its board of directors. The capital of the corporation is typically
calculated to be (and cannot be less than) the aggregate par value of all issued shares of capital stock. Net assets equal the fair value of the total assets minus total liabilities. The DGCL also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net
profits if, after the payment of the dividend, remaining capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets.

Further, declaration and payment of any dividend will be subject to the discretion of our board of directors. The time and amount of dividends will be
dependent upon our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, debt repayment obligations, capital expenditure needs, contractual restrictions, covenants in the agreements governing our current
and future indebtedness, industry trends, the provisions of Delaware law affecting the payment of distributions to stockholders and any other factors our board of directors may consider relevant. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay
cash dividends on our Class A common stock depends on our receipt of cash distributions from SOLV Energy Holdings LLC and, through SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, cash distributions and dividends from our other direct and indirect subsidiaries. We do
not currently intend to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our credit agreements and may be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or
preferred equity securities of us or our subsidiaries. See “Dividend Policy,” “Description of Material Indebtedness,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation” and
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock— We do not intend to pay any cash distributions or dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future.”

Anti-Takeover Provisions

Our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as they will be in effect immediately prior to the closing of this offering, will contain provisions that may delay, defer or discourage another party from acquiring control of us. We
expect that these provisions, which are summarized below, will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our
board of directors, which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of our stockholders. However, they also give our board of directors the power to discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may
favor.

Authorized but Unissued Shares

The
authorized but unissued shares of our common stock and our preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to any limitations imposed by the      rules. These additional shares may be
used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee benefit plans and funding of redemptions of LLC Interests. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make more
difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.

Classified Board of
Directors

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that our board of directors will be
divided into three classes, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible and each class serving three-year staggered terms. See “Management—Board Composition.” This provision may have the effect of deferring, delaying or
discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control of us or our management.

Removal of Directors

Directors may be removed by stockholders with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total combined voting power of our outstanding
common stock entitled to vote thereon.



148

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



Special Meetings of Stockholders

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that until the date when American Securities ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the
total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, a majority of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer, or our corporate
secretary at the request of the holders of at least a majority of the total combined voting power of our outstanding common stock. From and after the date when American Securities ceases to beneficially own more than 50% of the total combined voting
power of our outstanding common stock, only the chairperson of our board of directors, a majority of our board of directors, or our chief executive officer may call special meetings of our stockholders. This provision may delay the ability of our
stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for stockholders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.

Action by Written Consent of Stockholders

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, at any time when American Securities beneficially owns at least 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, our stockholders may take action by consent
without a meeting, and at any time when American Securities beneficially owns less than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, our stockholders may not take action by consent without a meeting, but may only take action at
a meeting of stockholders. This provision may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for stockholders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.

Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations

In addition, our amended and restated bylaws will establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of
stockholders, including proposed nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors. In order for any matter to be “properly brought” before a meeting, a stockholder will have to comply with advance notice requirements and
provide us with certain information. Stockholders at an annual meeting may only consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a qualified
stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has delivered timely written notice in proper form to our secretary of the stockholder’s intention to bring such business before the
meeting. These provisions could have the effect of delaying stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities until the next stockholder meeting.

Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws

The DGCL provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon is required to amend a corporation’s
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater percentage. Upon the closing of this offering, our bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority
vote of our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes which all our stockholders would be eligible to cast in an election of directors. Any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation must first
be approved by a majority of our board of directors and if required by law, thereafter be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon.

Section 203 of the DGCL

We will opt out of
Section 203 of the DGCL. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain provisions that are similar to Section 203. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, subject
to certain exceptions, we will not be able to engage in a “business combination” with any “interested stockholder” for three years following the date that the person became an interested stockholder, unless



149





Table of Contents

Confidential Treatment Requested by SOLV Energy, Inc.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A “business
combination” includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the “interested stockholder” and the sale of more than 10% of our assets. In general, an “interested stockholder” is any entity or person
beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such entity or person, but will exclude American Securities and its affiliates and transferees. Although we have
elected to opt out of the statute’s provisions, we could elect to be subject to Section 203 in the future.

Limitations on Liability and
Indemnification of Officers and Directors

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide
indemnification for our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. Prior to the closing of this offering, we intend to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that may, in some
cases, be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained under Delaware law. In addition, as permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes provisions that eliminate the personal liability
of our directors and officers for monetary damages resulting from breaches of certain fiduciary duties as a director or officer, applicable. The effect of this provision is to restrict our rights and the rights of our stockholders in derivative
suits to recover monetary damages against a director or officer for breach of fiduciary duties as a director or officer, as applicable.

These provisions
may be held not to be enforceable for violations of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Corporate Opportunity Doctrine

Delaware law permits corporations to adopt provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy in certain opportunities that are presented to the corporation or
its officers, directors or stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will, to the maximum extent permitted from time to time by Delaware law, renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in, or right to be offered an
opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities that are from time to time presented to American Securities or any of our directors who are employees of or affiliated with American Securities or any director or stockholder who is not
employed by us or our subsidiaries. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, American Securities or any of our directors who are employees of or affiliated with American
Securities or any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our affiliates will not have any duty to refrain from (i) engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lines of business in which we or our affiliates now
engage or propose to engage or (ii) otherwise competing with us or our affiliates. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, if American Securities or any of our directors who are employees of or affiliated with American Securities
or any director or stockholder who is not employed by us or our subsidiaries acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be a corporate opportunity for itself or himself or its or his affiliates or for us or
our affiliates, such person will have no duty to communicate or offer such transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and they may take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to another person or entity, unless such
opportunity was expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as a director, executive officer or employee of us or our affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, no potential transaction or business opportunity may be deemed
to be a corporate opportunity of the corporation or its subsidiaries unless (i) we or our subsidiaries would be permitted to undertake such transaction or opportunity in accordance with the amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
(ii) we or our subsidiaries, at such time have sufficient financial resources to undertake such transaction or opportunity, (iii) we have an interest or expectancy in such transaction or opportunity and (iv) such transaction or
opportunity would be in the same or similar line of our or our subsidiaries’ business in which we or our subsidiaries are engaged or a line of business that is reasonably related to, or a reasonable extension of, such line of business. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not renounce our interest in any business opportunity that is expressly offered to an employee director or employee in his or her capacity as a director or employee of SOLV Energy, Inc.

Dissenters’ Rights of Appraisal and Payment

Under the DGCL, with certain exceptions, our stockholders will have appraisal rights in connection with a merger or consolidation of SOLV Energy, Inc. Pursuant
to the DGCL, stockholders who properly request and perfect appraisal rights in connection with such merger or consolidation will have the right to receive payment of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.


Stockholders’ Derivative Actions

Under the
DGCL, any of our stockholders may bring an action in our name to procure a judgment in our favor, also known as a derivative action, provided that the stockholder bringing the action is a holder of our shares at the time of the transaction to which
the action relates or such stockholder’s stock thereafter devolved by operation of law.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE

Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class A common stock. Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market,
or the perception that sales may occur, could materially adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock at such time and our ability to raise equity capital in the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
this Offering and Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock—Future sales and issuances of our Class A common stock or rights to purchase our Class A common stock (or other equity securities or securities convertible into our
Class A common stock), including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, or the perception that future sales by us, our Sponsor or our other existing stockholders in the public market following this offering could cause dilution of the
percentage of ownership of our stockholders, could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.”

Sale of Restricted
Securities

Upon consummation of this offering, we will have




shares of our Class A common
stock outstanding (or




shares, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in full) and






shares of our Class B common stock outstanding (or




shares, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of Class A common stock in full). Of these shares, all shares of Class A common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable without further restriction or registration under the Securities Act, except that any shares
purchased by our “affiliates,” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (“Rule 144”), may generally only be sold in compliance with Rule 144, which is summarized below. Of the remaining outstanding
shares,




shares of our Class A common stock and




shares of our Class B common stock will be deemed “restricted
securities” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

In addition, the Continuing Equity Owners will own all of the shares of
our Class B common stock. The Continuing Equity Owners, from time to time following the offering, may require SOLV Energy Holdings LLC to redeem or exchange all or a portion of their LLC Interests for newly-issued shares of Class A common
stock on a
one-for-one
basis. Shares of our Class B common stock will be canceled on a

one-for-one
basis if we, following a redemption request of a Continuing Equity Owner, redeem or exchange LLC Interests of such Continuing Equity Owner pursuant to the
terms of the SOLV Energy Holdings LLC Agreement. Shares of our Class A common stock issuable to the Continuing Equity Owners upon a redemption or exchange of LLC Interests would be considered “restricted securities” as that term is
defined under Rule 144.

Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144
under the Securities Act, which is summarized below, or any other applicable exemption under the Securities Act, or pursuant to a registration statement that is effective under the Securities Act. Immediately following consummation of this offering,
the holders of approximately




shares of our Class A common stock (on an assumed
as-exchanged
basis) will be entitled to dispose of their shares
following the expiration of an initial
180-day

period pursuant to the holding period, volume and other restrictions of Rule 144.






are entitled to waive these
lock-up
provisions at their discretion prior to the expiration dates of such

lock-up
agreements.

Lock-up
Arrangements and Registration Rights


We, our officers, directors, Sponsor and our other Original Equity Owners representing substantially all of the LLC Interests prior to this offering
have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, that we and they will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for any shares of our Class A common stock, enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of
ownership of our Class A common stock, whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of our Class A common stock or other securities,

in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, without, in each
case, the prior written consent of




for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus. These agreements are subject to certain exceptions, as set forth in “Underwriting.”


In addition, following the expiration of the
lock-up
period, we expect that certain stockholders will have the
right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of our common stock under federal securities laws. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Registration Rights Agreement” for
additional information. There will not be any maximum cash penalties or additional penalties resulting from delays in registering our common stock associated with such registration rights. If these stockholders exercise this right, our other
existing stockholders may require us to register their registrable securities. If the offer and sale of these shares of our common stock are registered, the shares will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, subject to the
Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates, and a large number of shares may be sold into the public market.

Following the
lock-up
periods described above, all of the shares of our common stock that are restricted securities or are held by our affiliates as of the date of this prospectus will be eligible for sale in the public market in
compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

Rule 144

Affiliate Resales of Restricted Securities

In
general, beginning 90 days after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, a person who is an affiliate of ours, or who was an affiliate at any time during the 90 days before a sale, who has beneficially
owned shares of our Class A common stock for at least 180 days would be entitled to sell in “broker’s transactions” or certain “riskless principal transactions,” or to market makers, a number of shares within any
three-month period that does not exceed the greater of:





•




1% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding; and





•




the average weekly trading volume in our Class A common stock on





during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to such sale.

Affiliate resales under Rule 144 are also subject to the availability of current public information about us. In addition, if the number of shares of
Class A common stock being sold under Rule 144 by an affiliate during any three-month period exceeds 5,000 shares or has an aggregate sale price in excess of $50,000, the seller must file a notice on Form 144 with the SEC concurrently with
either the placing of a sale order with the broker or the execution directly with a market maker.

Non-Affiliate
Resales of Restricted Securities

Under Rule 144, a person who is not an affiliate of ours at the time of sale, and has not been an affiliate at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale,
and who has beneficially owned shares of our Class A common stock for at least six months but less than a year, is entitled to sell such shares subject only to the availability of current public information about us. If such person has held our
shares for at least one year, such person can resell without regard to any Rule 144 restrictions, including the
90-day
public company requirement and the current public information requirement.
Non-affiliate
resales are not subject to the manner of sale, volume limitation, or notice filing provisions of Rule 144.

Rule 701

Rule 701 generally allows a stockholder who
purchased shares of our capital stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but
without being required to



153





Table of Contents

comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their Rule 701 shares under
Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares, however, are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling those shares pursuant to Rule 701, subject to
the expiration of the
lock-up
agreements described above.

Additional Registration Statements

We intend to file one or more registration statements on Form
S-8
under the Securities Act to register shares of our
Class A common stock subject to issuance under our equity incentive plans. Any such registration statement will automatically become effective upon filing with the SEC. Accordingly, shares of our Class A common stock registered under such
registration statements will be available for sale in the open market, unless such shares are subject to the Rule 144 limitations, vesting restrictions with us or the
lock-up
restrictions described above.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS TO
NON-U.S.
HOLDERS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal
income tax consequences to
Non-U.S.
Holders (as defined below) of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of our Class A common stock issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a
complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxes and does not deal with other U.S. federal taxes (such as estate and gift tax laws) or with foreign, state, local or other tax laws
that may be relevant to
non-U.S.
holders in light of their particular circumstances.

This discussion is based on
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the IRS, in each case, in effect as of the date
hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a
Non-U.S.

Holder of our Class A common stock. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. We cannot assure that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below
regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, and disposition of our Class A common stock, or that a change in law will not alter significantly the tax considerations that we describe in this summary.

This discussion is limited to
Non-U.S.
Holders that hold our Class A common stock as a “capital asset”
within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a
Non-U.S.
Holder’s
particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to
Non-U.S.
Holders subject to special rules,
including, without limitation:





•




U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;





•




persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;





•




persons holding our Class A common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, or other risk-reduction strategy, or
as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment;





•




banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;





•




brokers, dealers, or traders in securities;





•




“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations
that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;





•




partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
investors therein);





•




tax-exempt
organizations or governmental organizations;






•




persons deemed to sell our Class A common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;






•




persons who hold or receive our Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option
or otherwise as compensation;





•




persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to our
Class A common stock being taken into account in an applicable financial statement;





•




tax-qualified
retirement plans; and





•




“qualified foreign pension funds” as defined in Section 897(l)(2) of the Code, and entities all of
the interests of which are held by qualified foreign pension funds.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our
Class A common stock, the tax treatment of an owner in such an entity will depend on the status of the owner, the activities of such entity, and certain determinations made at the owner level. Accordingly, entities treated as partnerships for
U.S. federal income tax purposes holding our Class A common stock and the owners in such entities should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

THIS DISCUSSION IS NOT TAX ADVICE. INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR
PARTICULAR SITUATIONS, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP, AND DISPOSITION OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS OR UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, OR
NON-U.S.
TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.

Definition of a
Non-U.S.
Holder

For purposes of this discussion, a
“Non-U.S.

Holder” is any beneficial owner of our Class A common stock that is neither a “U.S. person” nor an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person is any person that, for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:





•




an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;





•




a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or
organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;





•




an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or






•




a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (ii) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Distributions

As described in the section entitled
“Dividend Policy,” we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. However, in the event that we make a distribution of cash or other property (other than certain pro rata
distributions of our Class A common stock) in respect of shares of our Class A common stock, such distributions will generally be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated
earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and first be applied against and reduce a
Non-U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Class A common stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as capital gain and will be treated as described below under “—Sale or Other
Taxable Disposition.”

Subject to the discussion below on effectively connected income, dividends paid to a

Non-U.S.
Holder of our Class A common stock will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax
treaty, provided the
Non-U.S.
Holder furnishes a valid IRS Form
W-8BEN
or
W-8BEN-E
(or
other applicable documentation) certifying qualification for the lower treaty rate). A
Non-U.S.
Holder that does not timely furnish the required documentation, but that qualifies for a reduced treaty rate, may
be able to obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.
Non-U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to
benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.

If dividends paid to a
Non-U.S.
Holder are effectively connected
with the
Non-U.S.
Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a

Table of Contents

permanent establishment in the United States), the
Non-U.S.
Holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the
exemption, the
Non-U.S.
Holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form
W-8ECI,
certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the

Non-U.S.
Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

Any such effectively connected
dividends will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to United States persons (as defined by the Code) unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. A
Non-U.S.
Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected dividends, as
adjusted for certain items.
Non-U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules.

Sale or Other Taxable Disposition

Subject to the
discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, any gain realized by a
Non-U.S.
Holder on the sale or other taxable disposition of our Class A common stock generally will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax unless:





•




the gain is effectively connected with the
Non-U.S.
Holder’s conduct
of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States);





•




the
Non-U.S.
Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the
United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition (using certain calculations required under the Code) and certain other requirements are met; or





•




our Class A common stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest (“USRPI”) by reason of our
status as a U.S. real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Gain described in the
first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the rates and in the manner generally applicable to United States persons (as defined by the Code) unless an applicable income tax treaty provides
otherwise. A
Non-U.S.
Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected
gain, as adjusted for certain items.

A
Non-U.S.
Holder described in the second bullet point above will generally
be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on gain realized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of our Class A common stock, which may be offset by U.S. source
capital losses of the
Non-U.S.
Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the
Non-U.S.
Holder has timely filed U.S.
federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

With respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we currently are not, and do not
anticipate becoming, a USRPHC. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our USRPIs relative to the fair market value of our
non-U.S.
real property
interests and our other business assets, there can be no assurance we currently are not a USRPHC or will not become one in the future. Even if we are or were to become a USRPHC, gain arising from the sale or other taxable disposition by a
Non-U.S.
Holder of our Class A common stock will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax if our Class A common stock is “regularly traded,” as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an
established securities market, and such
Non-U.S.
Holder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of our Class A common stock throughout the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the
sale or other taxable disposition or the
Non-U.S.
Holder’s holding period.

Non-U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may
provide for different rules.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

A
non-U.S.
holder will generally not be subject to backup withholding on dividends received if such holder certifies
under penalty of perjury that it is a
non-U.S.
holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person as defined under the Code) such as by furnishing a valid
IRS Form
W-8BEN,

W-8BEN-E
or
W-8ECI,
or such holder otherwise establishes an exemption.
However, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS in connection with any distributions on our Class A common stock paid to the
Non-U.S.
Holder, regardless of whether such distributions
constitute dividends or whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition of our Class A common stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will
not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting, if the applicable withholding agent receives appropriate certifications and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person, or the holder otherwise
establishes an exemption.

Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an applicable
treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the
Non-U.S.
Holder resides or is established.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
Non-U.S.
Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Additional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts

Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code, such Sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or
FATCA, on certain types of payments made to
non-U.S.
financial institutions and certain other
non-U.S.
entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on
dividends on, or (subject to the proposed Treasury Regulations discussed below) gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our Class A common stock paid to a “foreign financial institution” or a
“non-financial
foreign entity” (each as defined in the Code), unless applicable exceptions apply. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the
United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules.

Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance, withholding under
FATCA generally applies to payments of dividends on our Class A common stock. However, under proposed Treasury Regulations (on which taxpayers may rely until final Treasury Regulations are issued), withholding under FATCA will not apply to the
gross proceeds from the sale or disposition of our Class A common stock. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued.

Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in our Class A
common stock.

THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS IS NOT TAX ADVICE. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT
ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING, OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY PROPOSED CHANGE IN APPLICABLE LAWS,
INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS OR TAX TREATIES.

UNDERWRITING

We are offering the shares of Class A common stock described in this prospectus through a number of underwriters. Jefferies LLC and J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC are acting as joint
book-running
managers of the offering and as representatives of the underwriters. We have entered into an underwriting agreement with the underwriters. Subject to the terms
and conditions of the underwriting agreement, we have agreed to sell to the underwriters, and each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase, at the public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions set forth on the cover page
of this prospectus, the number of shares of Class A common stock listed next to its name in the following table:




Name



Number of
Shares




Jefferies LLC










J.P. Morgan Securities LLC




Total














The underwriters are committed to purchasing all the shares of Class A common stock offered by us if they purchase any
shares of Class A common stock. The underwriting agreement also provides that if an underwriter defaults, the purchase commitments of
non-defaulting
underwriters may also be increased or the offering may
be terminated.

The underwriters propose to offer shares of Class A common stock directly to the public at the initial public offering price set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus and to certain dealers at that price less a concession not in excess of $   per share. Any such dealers may resell shares to certain other brokers or dealers at a discount of up to
$   per share from the initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the shares of Class A common stock to the public, if all of the shares of Class A common stock are not sold at the initial public offering
price, the underwriters may change the offering price and the other selling terms. Sales of any shares of Class A common stock made outside of the United States may be made by affiliates of the underwriters.

The underwriters have an option to buy up to      additional shares of Class A common stock from us to cover sales of shares by
the underwriters which exceed the number of shares of Class A common stock specified in the table above. The underwriters have 30 days from the date of this prospectus to exercise this option to purchase additional shares of Class A common
stock. If any shares of Class A common stock are purchased with this option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, the underwriters will purchase shares of Class A common stock in approximately the same proportion as
shown in the table above. If any additional shares of Class A common stock are purchased, the underwriters will offer the additional shares of Class A common stock on the same terms as those on which the shares of Class A common stock
are being offered.

The underwriting fee is equal to the public offering price per share of Class A common stock less the amount paid by the
underwriters to us per share of Class A common stock. The underwriting fee is $   per share. The following table shows the per share and total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters assuming both no
exercise and full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock.

We estimate that the total expenses of this offering, including registration, filing and listing fees,
printing fees and legal and accounting expenses, but excluding the underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $  . The underwriters have agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses in connection with this offering.


A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the websites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any,
participating in the offering. The underwriters may agree to allocate a number of shares of Class A common stock to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be
allocated by the representatives to underwriters and selling group members that may make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.

We, our directors and executive officers and certain holders of our outstanding common stock have signed
lock-up

agreements stating that we and they will not, in accordance with the terms of such agreements, dispose of or hedge any of our or their shares of common stock or securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock during the period
ending on the 180th day after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions.

We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

We will apply to have our Class A common stock approved for listing/quotation on the
under the symbol “MWH.”

In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions,
which involves making bids for, purchasing and selling shares of Class A common stock in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Class A common stock while this offering is in
progress. These stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of Class A common stock, which involves the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares of Class A common stock than they are required to purchase in this
offering, and purchasing shares of Class A common stock on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales may be “covered” shorts, which are short positions in an amount not greater than the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock referred to above, or may be “naked” shorts, which are short positions in excess of that amount. The underwriters may close out any covered short position either by
exercising their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, in whole or in part, or by purchasing shares of Class A common stock in the open market. In making this determination, the underwriters will consider, among
other things, the price of shares of Class A common stock available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters may purchase shares of Class A common stock through the option to purchase additional
shares of Class A common stock. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Class A common stock in the open market that could adversely
affect investors who purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a naked short position, they will purchase shares of Class A common stock in the open market to cover the position.

The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M of the Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that stabilize, maintain
or otherwise affect the price of the Class A common stock, including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the representatives of the underwriters purchase Class A common stock in the open market in stabilizing transactions or
to cover short sales, the representatives can require the underwriters that sold those shares of Class A common stock as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them.

These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Class A common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the
market price of the Class A common stock, and, as a result, the price of the Class A common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If the

underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may carry out these transactions on the     , in the
over-the-counter
market or otherwise.

Prior to this offering, there has been no
public market for our Class A common stock. The initial public offering price will be determined by negotiations between us and the representatives of the underwriters. In determining the initial public offering price, we and the
representatives of the underwriters expect to consider a number of factors including:





•




the information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to the representatives;






•




our prospects and the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;





•




an assessment of our management;





•




our prospects for future earnings;





•




the general condition of the securities markets at the time of this offering;





•




the recent market prices of, and demand for, publicly traded Class A common stock of generally comparable
companies; and





•




other factors deemed relevant by the underwriters and us.

Neither we nor the underwriters can assure investors that an active trading market will develop for our Class A common stock, or that the shares will
trade in the public market at or above the initial public offering price.

Other Relationships

Certain of the underwriters and their affiliates have provided in the past to us and our affiliates and may provide from time to time in the future certain
commercial banking, financial advisory, investment banking and other services for us and such affiliates in the ordinary course of their business, for which they have received and may continue to receive customary fees and commissions. In addition,
from time to time, certain of the underwriters and their affiliates may effect transactions for their own account or the account of customers, and hold on behalf of themselves or their customers, long or short positions in our debt or equity
securities or loans, and may do so in the future.

Selling Restrictions

Other than in the United States, no action has been taken by us or the underwriters that would permit a public offering of the securities offered by this
prospectus in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required. The securities offered by this prospectus may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this prospectus or any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the offer and sale of any such securities be distributed or published in any jurisdiction, except under circumstances that will result in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of that jurisdiction. Persons into whose
possession this prospectus comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering and the distribution of this prospectus. This prospectus does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an
offer to buy any securities offered by this prospectus in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or a solicitation is unlawful.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Unit Holders and the Board of Directors of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SOLV Energy Holdings LLC (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, member’s equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Basis for Opinion

These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required
to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the
financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to
be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the
critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on
the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition - Percentage of Completion Accounting




Description

of the Matter




For the year ended December 31, 2024, Engineering, Procurement and Construction (“EPC”) revenue recognized under Percentage of
Completion accounting was $1.9 billion. As explained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, EPC revenue is generally accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized over time using a
cost-to-cost
input method in which progress is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. The determination of revenue
recognized on EPC contracts requires estimates of total contract costs expected to be incurred to complete the Company’s contracts with its customers. Estimates to complete are based on the Company’s estimate of total expected costs,
including among others, for labor, materials, and subcontractor expenditures. Determination of these estimated costs require estimates of level of effort, as well as pricing.



Auditing the Company’s estimates to complete used in its revenue recognition
process was complex due to the judgement involved in evaluating the significant estimates and assumptions made by management.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit



To test the Company’s estimate to complete analyses, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating management’s cost estimates for a sample of contracts. We also compared estimates of labor, materials and
subcontractor costs to historical results of similar contracts to determine reasonableness of cost composition assumptions and inspected contractual evidence, such as purchase orders and supply contracts to corroborate completeness of estimates to
complete. We evaluated contract activity during the period subsequent to fiscal year end, but before the financial statements were issued to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s estimates. We evaluated the appropriateness of changes to
cost estimates and their impact on revenue, based on management’s determination that a change in estimate was necessary. We recalculated revenue recognized during the year based on the Company’s measurement of its estimate to complete
assumptions.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2022.

SOLV Energy Holdings LLC

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except units and per unit amounts)

(1) Description of Business

SOLV Energy Holdings LLC
(together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), is a leading provider of infrastructure services to the power industry, including engineering, procurement, construction (EPC), testing, commissioning, operations, maintenance and
repowering. The Company specializes in designing, building and maintaining utility-scale solar and battery storage projects and related transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure, and provides operation and maintenance (O&M) services
pursuant to long-term contracts that typically obligate the customer to pay the Company a fixed monthly fee for operations and routine preventative maintenance and additional fees for corrective maintenance on a time and materials basis.

The Company’s operations are conducted primarily through its subsidiaries, SOLV Energy, LLC, SEHV Solutions, LLC (collectively, “SOLV Energy”),
along with CS Energy LLC, and CS Energy Devco, LLC, (collectively, “CS Energy”).

The Company was formed on December 23, 2021, from the
acquisition of the Swinerton Renewable Energy EPC and O&M operating units (f/k/a SOLV Energy LLC) by American Securities LLC, a leading U.S. private equity firm, from Swinerton Inc
(“Carve-out”).


On October 7, 2024 (“Merger Date”), ASP Endeavor Acquisition LLC (“ASPE”), the parent company of CS Energy, merged with the
Company (“Merger”). The Company is the surviving entity in this merger of entities under common control. See Note 2 for additional information.

Subsequent to the Merger, the Company was renamed SOLV Energy Holdings LLC (f/k/a ASP SOLV Intermediate Holdings, LLC).

(2) Basis of Presentation

Due to the common control
ownership since 2021 of the Company and ASPE, the Merger was considered a merger between entities under common control and was accounted for in a manner similar to the pooling of interests method. The assets and liabilities of the Company and ASPE
were combined at their historical carrying amounts, less intercompany eliminations, and no goodwill was recognized. These financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the combined results of
operations, financial position, and cash flows of both entities as if the merger had occurred as of the earliest period presented, January 1, 2022.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries which reflect all adjustments necessary
to state fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Other parties’ interests in entities that the Company consolidates are reported as
non-controlling
interests within equity. Net income or loss
attributable to
non-controlling
interests is reported as a separate line item below net income or loss. The Company classifies certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related
contract or program as the Company’s operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. This primarily impacts contract liabilities and contract assets. The Company classifies all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset
will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year.

(3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

These consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The significant accounting policies described below,
together with other notes that follow, are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except units and per unit amounts)



Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and these notes.

Actual results could differ from those estimates and may result in
material effects on the Company’s operating results and financial position. Estimates made in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements primarily include, but are not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, goodwill
and long-lived asset valuations, impairment assessments and unit-based compensation.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company categorizes assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs
employed in the instrument. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs are quoted for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not
active. Level 3 inputs are model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value that is significant
to the valuation.

The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, contract assets and
contract liabilities, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and debt instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those
instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company’s debt instruments approximate their respective fair values.

Cash and Cash Equivalents


Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments which have an initial maturity of three months or less. The Company places its cash
and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, such amounts may be in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits.

Accounts Receivable

The Company sells to customers using credit terms customary in the construction industry. Accounts receivables are recorded at invoiced amounts and generally
do not bear interest. The Company provides an allowance for credit losses to estimate losses from uncollectible accounts in accordance with ASC 326,
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
.

Under this method an allowance is recorded based upon historical experience and management’s evaluation of, among other factors, current and reasonably
supportable expected future economic conditions and the customer’s willingness or ability to pay. The following table sets forth activities in the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated.

Project Development Costs

The Company capitalizes as project development costs only those costs incurred in connection with the development of solar and energy storage projects,
primarily direct labor, outside contractor services, consulting fees, legal fees and associated travel, if incurred after a point in time when the realization of related revenue becomes probable. Management continually reviews the feasibility of
each project and will
write-off
related proceeds to revenues and the capitalized project costs are written off to cost of revenues.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are
recorded at cost. Depreciation is recognized over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The range of estimated useful lives for the respective assets is as follows:



Machinery and equipment



5-7
years

Furniture and fixtures



5 years

Computer equipment



5 years

Vehicles



5 years

Software



3-7
years


Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized as incurred, while repairs and maintenance that do
not improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining terms of the underlying lease agreement.


Software Development Costs

The Company
capitalizes costs incurred to develop software for internal use.
Internal-use
software development costs are capitalized during the application development stage and are reflected in “Property and
Equipment” on the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software using the straight-line method, generally three to seven years, beginning when the software is ready for its intended
use. Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage and postimplementation-operation stage are expensed as incurred.

Long-Lived Assets


Long-lived assets that are held and used including definite lived intangibles, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate their carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360,
Property, Plant and Equipment
.

An impairment loss is indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset, or asset group, are less than its carrying
value. An impairment charge is measured as the excess of an asset, or asset group’s carrying amount over its fair value with the difference recorded within operating expenses in the consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair values are determined by a variety of valuation methods, including appraisals, sales prices of similar assets and present value techniques. Impairment
losses for assets, or asset groups, to be disposed of by sale are recognized at the lower of the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, or fair value less cost to sell.

There were no impairments of the Company’s long-lived assets in any of the periods presented.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except units and per unit amounts)



Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost paid over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired from businesses and is stated at
cost. The Company has recorded goodwill in connection with its historical acquisitions of businesses.

Goodwill is required to be assessed for impairment
at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on October 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances arise which indicate that the fair value of a
reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying amount. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

Qualitative factors assessed for each reporting unit include, among other things, enterprise value, macroeconomic conditions, cost factors and other industry
and market conditions.

If the Company believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting
unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test is required. The quantitative assessment estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using income and market approaches and compares that amount to the
carrying value of that reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge for the difference is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

Investments

The Company enters into investment
arrangements in the normal course of business. Investments in entities over which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are either considered marketable securities or

non-marketable
equity securities.
Non-marketable
equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative
under which they are measured at cost and adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, if any. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period,
including subsequent equity offerings or other reported transactions related to the same issuer. The Company recognizes impairments on marketable and
non-marketable
equity securities if there are sufficient
indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value.

Leases

The Company recognizes a
right-of-use
asset and lease liability for its leases
at the commencement date equal to the present value of the contractual minimum lease payments over the lease term. The present value is calculated using the rate implicit in the lease, if known, or the Company’s incremental secured borrowing
rate.

The Company accounts for each lease component and its associated
non-lease
components as a single lease
component for all classes of assets. The Company accounts for both lease and nonlease components under the lease accounting guidance.

The related lease
payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including, as applicable, any free-rent period during which the Company has the right to use the asset.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except units and per unit amounts)



Variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability are expensed as incurred. For
leases with renewal options where the renewal is reasonably assured, the lease term, including the renewal period, is used to determine the appropriate lease classification and to compute periodic rental expense. Leases with initial terms shorter
than twelve months are not recognized on the balance sheet, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis.

Refer to Note 9 -
Leases
for
additional information.

Income Taxes

SOLV
Energy Holdings LLC is a limited liability company treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, U.S. federal income taxes are not recognized at the Company level but rather its income is allocated to its members.


As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had no uncertain tax positions. The Company has elected to recognize interest and penalties related to
income tax matters as a component of income tax expense, of which no interest or penalties were recorded in any of the periods presented.

Debt
Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs include external costs incurred to obtain financing. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the respective term
of the financing using the effective interest method.

Debt issuance costs are generally presented on the consolidated balance sheets along with
unamortized debt discounts as a reduction to current and long-term debt.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 5 -
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
for additional information.

Unit-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes
compensation expense for unit-based arrangements over the requisite service period of the awards and recognizes forfeitures as they occur. Refer to Note 10 –
Unit-Based Compensation
for additional information.

Multiemployer Pension Plans

The Company
participates in construction-industry multiemployer pension plans. Generally, the plans provide defined benefits to substantially all employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Contributions are based on the hours worked by employees
covered under various collective bargaining agreements. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a contributor to a multiemployer pension plan is only liable for its proportionate share of a plan’s unfunded vested liability upon
termination, or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. Refer to Note 11 –
Employee Benefit Plans
for additional information.

(5) Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Revenue Overview

The Company applies the guidance
in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), when recognizing revenue associated with its contracts with customers. The Company generates revenue from the construction of new solar, battery storage, T&D or other projects
pursuant to EPC contracts. The Company also generates revenue from maintaining, upgrading, repowering or expanding of existing solar, battery storage or T&D projects pursuant to O&M agreements. The Company’s other revenues include
development fees from the sale of projects the Company developed and sold to third parties and certain construction management services no longer offered.

For substantially all of the Company’s EPC contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the
continuous transfer of control to the customer and the Company’s continuous right to payment throughout the contracts’ duration.

Contracts
where the Company provides a significant service of integrating a set of tasks and components into a single project or capability, are accounted for as a single performance obligation.

The Company recognizes revenue using the
percentage-of-completion
method (an
input method), based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated costs. Costs related to uninstalled materials are included in this calculation when the cost is incurred (when control is transferred). This method is the most accurate
measure of the Company’s contract performance because it directly measures the value of the goods and services transferred to the customer.

Estimated costs include the Company’s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs, materials, subcontractor costs, among other
costs. Changes to total estimated costs or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined to be assessed at the contract level. Additionally, the Company recognizes revenues on certain uninstalled materials that are
specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project.

Revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when the cost is incurred (when
control is transferred). Precontract costs are expensed as incurred. Because of inherent uncertainties in estimating total costs on uncompleted jobs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change in the near term. Estimates
are reviewed and updated quarterly.

O&M agreements may include multiple performance obligations. The Company allocates the transaction price to each
performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. For standard O&M agreements with specified service periods, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service
period when inputs are expended evenly, and the customer receives and consumes the benefits of performance throughout the contract term. For other O&M agreements that are performed based on time and materials rates, such as repair, replacement,
and refurbishment services, progress towards complete satisfaction of such performance obligations is measured using an output method as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of performance completed to date.

Revenues recognized by the Company from the sale of development projects are recognized at a point in time when control of the related project transfers to the
customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the project.

The Company bills as work
progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing.

Variable Consideration

The nature of the Company’s contracts gives rise to variable consideration, including unexecuted change orders and liquidated damage penalties. Change
orders are generally not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract. The Company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant
reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration by using
the expected value or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount.

Estimates of variable consideration and the
determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of the anticipated performance and all information (historical, current, and forecasted) that is reasonably available including, but not
limited to, contractual entitlement and documented approval by customers. Amounts associated with change orders are recognized as revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted, and the amount of such adjustment can be reliably
estimated. The effect of variable consideration on the transaction price, and the Company’s measure of progress for the performance obligation for which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue on a cumulative
catch-up
basis.

Practical Expedient

If the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company’s performance completed
to date, the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed.

Remaining Performance Obligations


Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of customer orders for which the work has not been performed. As of
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $1,981,253, $1,303,315 and $1,263,800, respectively, which related to the Company’s EPC service contracts.
The Company anticipates recognizing revenue on substantially all the remaining performance obligations under these contracts over the next twelve months.

For the Company’s O&M agreements, the Company has elected to apply the optional exemption, which waives the requirement to disclose the remaining
performance obligation for revenue recognized through the right to invoice practical expedient.

Contract Assets and Liabilities

Unbilled and retention receivables represent the revenue recognized but not yet billed pursuant to contract terms or amounts billed after the period end. The
Company anticipates that substantially all unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next twelve months. Billings do not necessarily correlate to revenue recognized over time using the
cost-to-cost
input method.

Deferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers in excess of revenue
recognized to date. The Company anticipates that substantially all such amounts will be earned over the next twelve months.

During the years ended
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $169,062, $92,120 and $315,050 related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the end of each respective prior year.

Contract assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

Contract assets and liabilities fluctuate period to period based primarily on changes in the number and size of projects in
progress at period end, variability in billing and payment terms, and the amounts of unapproved change orders and contract claims. The decrease in contract assets for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is due primarily to completion of
certain large projects and the corresponding billing of amounts previously recorded as contract assets. The increase in contract liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2024 is due primarily to timing of billings in relation to costs
incurred on certain large projects. The decrease in contract liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2023 is due to completion of certain large projects and satisfaction of performance obligations related to contract amounts previously
billed.

(6) Segment Information

The Company
operates in one reportable segment which derives revenue through providing EPC, O&M and Development services throughout the Unites Sates. The Company derives most of its revenue from its EPC contracts.

The Company’s operations are managed by segment managers who report to the Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker
(“CODM”). The Company’s two operating segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment due to their similar economic characteristics, nature of services, type of customers and service distribution.

This segment structure reflects the financial information and reports used by the CODM to make decisions regarding the Company’s business, including
performance assessments and strategic and operational planning in compliance with ASC 280,
Segment Reporting
.

(7) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill


In connection with the 2024, 2023 and 2022 annual goodwill impairment assessments, management elected to bypass performing qualitative impairment
assessments and proceeded directly to performing quantitative impairment tests of the Company’s reporting units. The results of these quantitative tests indicated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units exceeded its
carrying amount, and therefore, no goodwill impairment charge was recognized in 2024, 2023 or 2022. Therefore, there were no changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the period ended December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024.

CS Energy

Prior
to the Merger, on May 3, 2021, CS Energy entered into an amended and restated revolving $30,000 Credit and Guaranty Agreement with a lender (the “2021 Revolving Facility”).

Borrowings under the 2021 Revolving Facility bore interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.75%. In addition to interest, CS Energy was
also responsible for commitment, letter of credit and fronting fees as defined in the agreement.

2022 Revolving Facility

On July 13, 2022, CS Energy entered into a second amendment to the 2021 Revolving Facility to assign the facility from the existing creditor to a new
creditor (the “CS Revolving Facility”).

Advances on the CS Revolving Facility could be used for working capital and general corporate purposes
and for payment of fees and expenses relating to the facility. Included in the facility was a $25,000 letter of credit subfacility. Outstanding letters of credit reduced the amount available under the CS Revolving Facility. Total letters of credit
issued against the facility at December 31, 2023 amounted to approximately $4,723. There were no borrowings under the CS Revolving Facility at December 31, 2023. The assigned revolving facility would have expired on May 3, 2026.

Borrowings under the 2022 Revolving Facility bore interest at the alternate base rate plus 3.50% with a term Secured Overnight Financing Rate
(“SOFR”) spread adjustment of 0.10% per annum. In addition to interest, CS Energy was also responsible for commitment, letter of credit and fronting fees as defined in the agreement. The average interest rate was 8.8% and 8.6% for the
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

In connection with the Merger, amounts under the CS Revolving Facility were settled and the
facility was terminated. Therefore, there were no letters of credit issued against the facility or borrowings under the CS Revolving Facility at December 31, 2024.

Term Loan

Prior to the Merger, on May 3, 2021, CS
Energy entered into a credit agreement (the “Term Loan”) with various lenders for $125,000.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



SOLV Energy Holdings LLC

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except units and per unit amounts)



There was an election that allowed CS Energy to determine whether the loan could convert to a Eurocurrency
borrowing, which could bear interest influenced by LIBOR plus the Eurocurrency Applicable Rate of 6.5%. The election was made to convert the loan to a Eurocurrency borrowing (collectively, the “Eurocurrency Borrowing”).

The Eurocurrency Borrowings, which were in Unites States dollars, bore interest at LIBOR, with the option to select a one month, three month or six month rate
with a minimum rate of 0.5%, plus the Eurocurrency Applicable Rate of 6.5%, and could be applied to the outstanding principal balance.

On May 12,
2023, CS Energy entered into a third amendment to the Term Loan to convert the Eurocurrency Borrowings to a Term SOFR borrowing, which bore interest at Adjusted Term SOFR, with the option to select a one month, three month, or six month rate with a
minimum rate of 0.5%, plus the Term SOFR Applicable Rate of 6.5%, and could be applied to the outstanding principal balance.

There were four interest
periods during each fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, ending on the 5th day of the following months: February, May, August and November. The interest rate used was the Adjusted Term SOFR

3-month
on a date that was two business days prior to the commencement of the interest period. The average interest rate was 11.7% and 8.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.


The principal was paid at the end of every fiscal quarter. The principal to be paid each quarter was equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of
the Term Loan, which resulted in a total of $1,250 being paid annually with a $118,125 balloon payment due in 2027. The Term Loan also provided for annual mandatory prepayments based on Excess Cash Flow, as defined by the agreement. These
prepayments were due on the fifth business day after the date on which the financial statements were required to be delivered commencing with the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Term Loan had a maturity date of
May 3, 2027.

On October 7, 2024, in connection with the Merger, the Term Loan was fully settled and loss on extinguishment of $1,379 was
recorded. Therefore, during fiscal year ended 2024, only three of the four aforementioned interest periods occurred and the average interest rate was 12.0% for the respective periods.

SOLV Energy

Revolving Credit Facility

Prior to the Merger, SOLV Energy also entered a revolving credit facility with various lenders (the “Revolver”) which provided a $60,000 revolving
line of credit through December 2025.

Borrowings under the Revolver bore interest, at SOLV Energy’s option, with an applicable rate of 2.75% plus
the option of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, the Prime Rate, or to the extent ascertainable a base rate of 3.75% plus the Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00%.

Furthermore, the Revolver has a maturity date of December 2025. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, SOLV
Energy paid a commitment fee (0.50%) to the lenders under the Revolver in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. No amounts were drawn against the revolver as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

In 2022, various lenders issued letters of credit totaling $18,700 as of December 31, 2022. In 2023, additional letters of credit were issued, with
$19,445 outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The letters of credit were valid

until December 2024 and are collateralized by the Revolver, reducing the amount available under the Revolver to $40,555 as of December 31, 2023. No amounts were drawn against the letters of
credit as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

On October 7, 2024, in connection with the Merger, the Company amended the Revolver (the “Amended
Revolver”) to increase the borrowing to $90,000. There were no changes to the lenders under the Amended Revolver.

The interest rate on the Amended
Revolver is, at the Company’s option, the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Effective Rate, as defined in the Amended Revolver agreement, plus 0.50%, (b) the Prime Rate, as defined in the Amended Revolver agreement, or (c) the Term
SOFR, as defined in the Amended Revolver agreement for a
one-month
tenor (not less than the applicable floor) plus 1.00%. The Company had $11,083 of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the Amended
Revolver as of December 31, 2024. The Amended Revolver matures on October 7, 2028.

Credit Agreement

Prior to the Merger, in 2021, SOLV Energy entered into a term credit agreement (“Original Credit Agreement”) with various lenders. The Original
Credit Agreement provided for a term loan pursuant to which the lenders agreed to lend $275,000. Interest and principal were payable in quarterly installments with fixed quarterly principal payments of $688 beginning in March 2022, and a balloon
payment of $259,188 in December 2027.

Borrowings under the Original Credit Agreement bore interest, at SOLV Energy’s option, with an applicable rate
of 5.75% plus the option of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, the Prime Rate, or to the extent ascertainable a base rate of 6.75% plus the Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00%.

On October 7, 2024, in connection with the Merger, the Company amended the Original Credit Agreement to increase the borrowing to $373,700 (the
“Amended Credit Agreement”). As a result of the amendment, certain lenders under the Original Credit Agreement are no longer participants of the Amended Credit Agreement and new lenders joined the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company
accounted for the Amended Credit Agreement as a debt modification or extinguishment on a
lender-by-lender
basis in according with applicable accounting guidance and recorded a $3,019 loss for the year ended
December 31, 2024 in “Loss on debt extinguishment” on the consolidated statement of operations.

Interest on the Amended Credit Agreement
is based on the historical Q4 2024 term SOFR plus a spread, as elected by the Company. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Agreement will amortize in equal quarterly installments, with aggregate annual payments equal to 1.00% of the original
principal amount, and the remaining balance payable upon maturity. The Amended Credit Agreement matures on October 7, 2029. For the year ended December 31, 2024, in accordance with the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company paid one
quarterly principal and interest payment of $959 with an interest rate of 11.34%.

Equipment Financing

In 2023, the Company entered into an equipment financing transaction with a specialized equipment finance provider to borrow approximately $25,000 against
construction equipment owned by the Company. The proceeds from the transaction were recognized as a financing liability, with subsequent payments being allocated between interest expense and reduction of the financing liability.

The underlying financing agreements comprising the financing liability are
72-month
terms ending in 2029. During the
years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company made payments of approximately $5,388 and $3,136 to the equipment finance provider, consisting of principal of $3,468 and $1,831, interest expense of $1,920 and $1,305, based on an implicit
interest rate of approximately 12%. The financed assets, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $16,274 and $21,309 and are included in property and equipment.

(10) Unit-based Compensation

CS Energy

Prior to the Merger, CS Energy
recognized unit-based compensation expense as CS Energy’s parent partnership issued the equity awards to employees and nonemployees of CS Energy (“CS Energy Class B Units”).

Vested CS Energy Class B Units could have been converted to Class A Units of ASPE with a payment equal to the conversion price laid out in the
respective grant agreements. Any vested CS Energy Class B Units not converted into Class A Units were required to be forfeited.

CS Energy could
elect to repurchase the vested units if an employee resigned voluntarily, or a nonemployee terminated services. Unvested units were forfeited as of the termination date. Additionally, upon a change in control, unvested CS Energy Class B Units
become fully vested. Vested and unvested units were canceled upon a termination for a cause. Subsequent to the Merger, the CS Energy Class B Units were exchanged for Restricted Class C Units (“Additional C Units”) in SOLV Energy
Management Holdings, LP, a parent entity of the Company, as explained within this footnote. Therefore, there were no CS Energy Class B Units outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

Three types of CS Energy Class B Unit awards were granted during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 as follows.

Class
B-1
Units Time-based awards
– These awards vested and became fully
exercisable on the fifth anniversary, with 20% exercisable on each of the first five anniversaries of the corresponding vesting start date, subject to the employee’s and the nonemployee’s continued service through the vesting dates.

Class
B-1
Units Performance-based awards
– These awards vested as a
function of achieving the EBITDA Target for each fiscal year over five and a half years, with the final fiscal year measured on a trailing
12-month
basis, subject to the employee’s continued service
through the vesting dates. Additionally, these awards included the Cumulative EBITDA Target in a later fiscal year, whereas the applicable percentage vesting for such later fiscal year and each previous fiscal year would vest as of the last day of
such later fiscal year. Finally, all such awards were fully vested on the eight anniversaries from the grant date regardless of the EBITDA Targets for any fiscal year or the Cumulative EBITDA Targets as set forth in the respective grant agreements.

Class
B-2
Units
Performance-based awards
– These awards were subject to market and performance conditions. The performance condition required the consummation of a transaction as defined in the Restricted

Class B-2
Unit Award Agreement and the market condition required that the aforementioned transaction met investor return thresholds in order to vest. As the performance condition was a transaction event,
the performance condition would only become probable once a transaction was consummated. Accordingly, as a transaction did not occur during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022, CS Energy did not record any share-based compensation expense
related to this award.

For the CS Energy
B-1
Units, CS Energy measured the estimated grant date fair value of
$0.018 and $0.029 per unit using an option pricing method and recognized approximately $905 and $821 in share-based compensation for these awards for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. CS Energy recorded share-based compensation expense
for the CS Energy
B-1
Units of $830 for the year ended December 31, 2024. The share-based compensation expense is recorded in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ of the consolidated
statement of operations.

SOLV Energy

Restricted Class C Units

The Company, from time
to time, grants Restricted Class C Units to employees and
non-employees,
with time, performance and multiple on invested capital (“MOIC”) vesting (collectively, “Legacy SOLV Units”).


Time-vested units
– These units vest 20% each year and become fully vested upon the fifth anniversary of the vesting start
date, subject to each recipient having been an employee or key
non-employee
at all times from the grant date through each vesting date.

Performance-vested units
– These units vest upon the achievement of certain EBITDA performance targets, with 20% of the
performance-vested units becoming exercisable as of the last day of the fiscal year. All performance-vested units become fully vested on the eighth anniversary of the grant date, whether or not the Company meets some or all of the performance
targets for any fiscal year, so long as the recipient continues to be an employee or key
non-employee
at all times from the grant date through the eighth anniversary of the grant date.

MOIC-vested units
– These units vest only upon a cash distribution threshold being achieved. Compensation expense will be
recognized for all awards when the distribution threshold is met and therefore, no compensation expense was recorded related to the Legacy SOLV MOIC-vested units for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Pursuant to the Merger, on October 25, 2024, Restricted Class C Units (“Additional C Units”) were awarded to certain employees and key
non-employees
of CS Energy, including

directors, consultants and independent contractors, in exchange for CS Energy Class B Units. Upon the Merger, all
unvested CS Energy Class B Units vested, accordance with the CS Energy Class B Units terms and conditions. Under the terms of the newly issued Additional C Units, the units vest twenty percent on their initial grant date, then ratably over
the annual four-year period.

(in thousands, except units and per unit amounts)



The Company determined that the exchange of the CS Energy

Class B-1
Units Time-based and
Class B-1
Performance-based awards for Additional C Units are Type I modifications pursuant to ASC 718¸
Compensation
– Stock Compensation
(“ASC 718”) because the awards prior to and after the exchange are expected to vest.

As a result of the exchange,
the Company recognized a
one-time
incremental expense of approximately $776 for the vested awards in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. An incremental expense of
approximately $1,897 will be recognized for the unvested awards over the remaining vesting period.

The Company determined that the exchange of the CS
Energy
Class B-2
Units Performance-based awards for Class C Units is a Type III modification pursuant to ASC 718 because the
Class B-2
Units
Performance-based awards vesting condition was deemed improbable whereas the Class C Units vesting condition was deemed probable. As of the date of the exchange, total incremental stock-based compensation expense was $1,743, which will be
recognized over the remaining service periods of the
Class B-2
Units Performance-based awards.

Pursuant to
the Merger, the vesting terms of the Legacy SOLV MOIC-vested units were modified. Prior to the Merger, these units were to vest ultimately upon a liquidity event once a certain investment return multiple was achieved. This provision was amended so
that the units now vest only upon a certain cash distribution threshold being achieved. The Company determined this to be a Type IV modification pursuant to ASC 718 because the MOIC-vested unit vesting conditions were deemed improbable both prior to
and after this modification. Accordingly, no incremental expense was recognized on the modification date and will only be recognized if and when the vesting conditions are met.

The following tables summarize the Company’s Legacy SOLV Unit and Additional Class C Unit activity, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023

Restricted Unit Appreciation (“RUA”) Plan

On December 23, 2021, the Company adopted the SOLV Energy, LLC RUA Plan (the “Plan”) and granted a total of 48,000 RUA awards with an estimated
fair value of $4,800 to certain employees. The awards follow an employee payment model, requiring classification as a liability that is measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in fair value are recognized as cumulative
adjustments to compensation expense each period.

The fair value of RUA awards is measured based on the fair value of Class A Units of SOLV Energy
Parent Holdings LP, which is estimated using generally accepted equity valuation and allocation methods. The fair value of RUA awards is derived from unobservable inputs and is therefore a level 3 measurement.

The awards vest ratably over the twelve-month requisite service period the rewards are earned. Fully vested awards granted by the Company that have not
forfeited are settled in cash in the earlier of 60 days following a sale of substantially all of the assets or 50% or more of the partnership’s interests of SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP or the fifth-year anniversary date of the grant. The
holders receive for each vested RUA award an amount in cash equal to the fair market value of one share of Class A Unit of SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP on the trigger date, as specified in the applicable award agreement. Grantees, upon
termination from services, may elect to settle their fully vested awards for cash, in this case equal to the grant date fair value of the award.

A
summary of the activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

(11) Employee Benefit Plans

Union’s Multiemployer Pension Plans

The
Company contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of a collective bargaining agreements (“CBA”) with various unions that covers its union-represented employees. Approximately 10.4% of

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



SOLV Energy Holdings LLC

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(in thousands, except units and per unit amounts)



the Company’s employees as of December 31, 2024 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 2.4% of the Company’s employees as of December 31, 2024 were
covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire within the next twelve months. The Company’s multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the CBAs (usually on a monthly or annual basis), and contributions are
made to the plans on a
“pay-as-you-go”
basis based on its union employee payrolls. The Company may also have additional
liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain
liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multiemployer pension plan if the employer withdraws or is deemed to have withdrawn from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal.

The risks of participating in the multiemployer plan is different from single-employer plans in the following respects:

1. Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.


2. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining
participating employers.

3. If the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required
to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)
also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans in the United States that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or
“critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’s funded percentage, cash flow position and whether a projected minimum funding deficiency exists). Plans in these classifications must adopt remedial
measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement plan (“FIP”) or rehabilitation plan (“RP”), as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on
benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which the Company contributes or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The
amount of additional funds, if any, that the Company may be obligated to contribute to these plans cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainty regarding the amount of future work involving covered union employees, future contribution levels
and possible surcharges on plan contributions.

The following table summarizes plan information relating to the Company’s participation in
multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, including company contributions for the last three years, the status of the plans under the PPA and whether the plans are subject to a FIP or RP or contribution surcharges. The most recent PPA zone status
available in 2024 and 2023 generally relates to the plans’ fiscal year-ends in 2023 and 2022. Forms 5500 were not yet available for the plan years ending in 2024. The PPA zone status is based on information that the Company received from the
respective plans’ administrators, as well as publicly available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website, and is certified by each plan’s actuary. Although multiple factors or tests may result in red zone or yellow zone status,
plans in the red zone generally are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone generally are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone generally are at least 80 percent funded. Under the PPA, red zone plans
are classified as “critical” status, yellow zone plans are classified as “endangered” status and green zone plans are classified as neither “endangered” nor “critical” status. The “FIP/RP Status”
column indicates plans for which a FIP or a RP is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the

Total contributions made to all of these multiemployer plans correspond to the number of union employees
employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and participation in project labor agreements and vary depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources or project labor
agreements in connection with such projects. Contributions to such plans are also impacted by business combinations and changes in employer contribution rates.

401(k) Plans

The Company maintains 401(k) plans
whereby employees may contribute a percentage of their compensation, not to exceed the maximum amount allowable under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company may elect to make matching or other contributions into the savings plan. Contributions made

(12) Member’s Equity

SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP holds 100% of the limited liability company interests of the Company. SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP’s interests are
generally consistent with ordinary equity ownership interests.

The Company maintains a share-based compensation plan, held by SOLV Energy Parent Holdings
LP, a parent holding company above the consolidation of the Company. The presentation of unitbased equity awards is represented in the caption, Member’s equity, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Refer to Note 11 –
Employee Benefit Plans
for the reconciliation of outstanding awards under the plan as well as details related to share-based
compensation.

(13) Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company
is involved in various lawsuits, claims, inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters, most of which are routine to the nature of the Company’s business. When it is probable that a loss will be incurred and where a range of the loss
can be reasonably estimated, the best estimate within the range is accrued.

When the best estimate within the range cannot be determined, the low end of
the range is accrued. The ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results of operations should the Company’s exposure be materially different from its estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously accrued.
Potential insurance reimbursements are not offset against potential liabilities.

Because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and
litigation, future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities accrued; however, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses.

If information were to become available that allowed the Company to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what
was accrued, the Company would adjust its accrued liabilities

accordingly. Additional lawsuits, claims, inquiries and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future. The range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed
as they arise; until then, a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined.

Based upon current information, the Company concluded
that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Warranties

The Company provides warranties for
EPC and O&M projects, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in equipment, materials, design, or workmanship. The length of the warranty period is generally two years. Materials and equipment used in construction are either provided by
the customers or warranted against defects by suppliers. The warranty claims that the Company historically received have not been substantial. See Note 15
– Details of Certain Accounts
for warranty reserves recorded on the consolidated
balance sheets.

Concentration of Risks

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of contract receivables including retention. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit to its customers and does not generally require collateral. The Company
monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with these receivables on an ongoing basis.

The Company has not historically experienced significant
credit losses, due primarily to management’s assessment of customers’ credit ratings. The Company principally deals with recurring customers whose reputations are known to management.

The Company performs credit checks for significant new customers and generally requires progress payments for significant projects. The following customers
each comprised 10% or more of the Company’s total accounts receivable:

Several
of the Company’s key raw materials, components and manufacturing equipment are either single-sourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers. Shortages of essential components and equipment could occur due to increases in demand or
interruptions of supply, which may be exacerbated by the availability of logistics services, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s ability to meet customer demand for its services.

Consulting Agreement”) and SOLV (the “SOLV Consulting Agreement” and together with the CS Consulting Agreement, the “Consulting Agreements”), pursuant to which American Securities agreed to provide certain management and
legal services in exchange for an aggregate annual fee of $3,000 million in equal quarterly cash installments, plus reimbursable expenses.

In connection
with the CS Merger, the CS Consulting Agreement was terminated and the SOLV Consulting Agreement was amended to increase the annual fee to $3,000 payable in equal quarterly cash installments. Payments made to American Securities under the Consulting
Agreements during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses.”

(16) Subsequent Events

Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were available to be issued of May 9, 2025 for disclosure or
recognition in the consolidated financial statements and concluded there were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure except for the following:

Acquisition

On January 8, 2025, the Company
acquired 100% of the ownership interests in Sacramento Drilling, Inc (“SDI”), a solar predrill and pile foundation installation contractor based in Sacramento, California.

The aggregate consideration for the acquisition was approximately $19,500, of which approximately $14,000 was paid in cash at closing and $5,500 is deferred
and payable on the
one-year
anniversary of the acquisition.

Simultaneously with the acquisition, SDI and SOLV
Energy, LLC entered into an equipment financing transaction with a specialized equipment finance provider to borrow approximately $14,500 against construction equipment owned by SDI. The proceeds were used to fund the closing payment on the
acquisition date.

Due to the timing of the acquisition, the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete as of the date of these
financial statements were available to be issued. The Company is in the process of determining the fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. The Company expects to complete this
assessment within the measurement period, which may extend up to one year from the acquisition date. Any necessary adjustments will be recorded retrospectively as of the acquisition date.

Term Loan

On January 9, 2025, the Company
borrowed an additional $32,500 on its Amended Credit Agreement.

To be provided by amendment

Item 14. Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

Section 102 of the DGCL allows a corporation to provide in its certificate of incorporation that a director or officer of the corporation will not be
personally liable to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except where the director or officer breached the duty of loyalty, failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional
misconduct or knowingly violated a law, authorized the payment of a dividend or approved a stock repurchase in violation of Delaware corporate law, obtained an improper personal benefit or, with respect to an officer only, in any action by or in the
right of the corporation. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which will become effective upon the closing of this offering, will provide that no director or officer of SOLV Energy, Inc. shall be personally liable to it or its
stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, as applicable, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it may be amended.

Section 145 of the DGCL provides that a corporation has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee, or agent of the corporation, or a person
serving at the request of the corporation for another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise in related capacities, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) (and, with respect to actions other than actions
brought by or in the right of the corporation, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with an action, suit or proceeding to which he or she was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by reason of such position, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation, and, in any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, except that, in the case of actions brought by or in the right of the corporation, no indemnification shall be made with
respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or other adjudicating court determines that, despite the
adjudication of liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Delaware Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 200.83.



Our amended and restated bylaws will authorize the indemnification of our officers and directors, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any person, or a Covered Person, who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
by reason of the fact that he or she, or a person for whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Company or, while a director or officer of the Company, is or was serving at the request of the Company as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and
loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such Covered Person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise
provided in our amended and restated bylaws, the Company shall be required to indemnify a Covered Person in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such Covered Person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof)
by the Covered Person was authorized in the specific case by the board of directors.

We intend to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our
executive officers and directors. These agreements, among other things, will require the Company to indemnify each executive officer and director to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, including indemnification of expenses, such as
attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by the director or executive officer in any action or proceeding, including any action or proceeding by or in right of the Company, arising out of the person’s services as a
director or executive officer.

We expect to maintain standard policies of insurance that provide coverage (i) to our directors and officers against
loss rising from claims made by reason of breach of duty or other wrongful act and (ii) to the Company with respect to indemnification payments that it may make to such directors and officers.

In any underwriting agreement we enter into in connection with the sale of Class A common stock being registered hereby, the underwriters will agree to
indemnify, under certain conditions, us, our directors, our officers and persons who control us within the meaning of the Securities Act against certain liabilities.

Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.

On April 1, 2025, SOLV Energy, Inc. agreed to issue 100 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, which will be redeemed upon the consummation of
the Transactions, to SOLV Energy Parent Holdings LP in exchange for $100.00. The issuance was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering.

Item 17. Undertakings.

The undersigned registrant
hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters, at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the
event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a
court of appropriate jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:





(1)


For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of
prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of
this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.





(2)


For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that
contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Corporation or to its stockholders, such Indemnified Party acting under these Bylaws shall not be liable to the Corporation or to its stockholders for its good faith reliance on the
provisions of these Bylaws. The provisions of these Bylaws, to the extent that they restrict, modify or eliminate the duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Party otherwise existing at law or in equity, shall replace such other duties and

is to be made against the Corporation, give written notice to the Corporation of the commencement of such Proceeding;

Indemnified Party (other than a derivative suit in right of the Corporation), the Corporation will be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense thereof to the extent that the Corporation may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Party. After notice from the Corporation to such Indemnified Party of the Corporation’s election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the Corporation will not be liable for expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. The Corporation will not consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of such Proceeding that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or

executors and administrators. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of
Sections 2
and
3
of this
Article XIII
that adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party or its successors shall be prospective only and shall not limit
or eliminate any such right with respect to any proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal.

behalf or at the request of the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, in such capacity, whether the Indemnity Obligations are created by law, organizational or constituent documents, contract (including these Bylaws) or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the fact that such stockholder and/ or any of its affiliates, other than the Corporation (such persons, together with its and their heirs, successors and assigns, the “
Stockholder Parties

Indemnified Party with respect to the Indemnity Obligations, in no event shall the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries have any right or claim against any of the Stockholder Parties for contribution or have rights of subrogation against any of
the Stockholder Parties through an Indemnified Party for any payment made by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries with respect to any Indemnity Obligation. In addition, in the event that any Stockholder Parties pay or advance to an Indemnified
Party any amount with respect to an Indemnity Obligation, the Corporation shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries to, as applicable, promptly reimburse such Stockholder Party for such payment or advance upon request.

IFRS as described below) on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the Required Lenders request an amendment to any provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is
given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change becomes effective until such notice have been withdrawn or
such provision amended in accordance herewith;
provided
,
further
, that if such an amendment is requested by the Borrower or the Required Lenders, then the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required
Lenders) shall negotiate in good faith to enter into an amendment of the relevant affected provisions (without the payment of any amendment or similar fee to the Lenders) to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in GAAP or the
application thereof;
provided
,
further
, that all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made without giving effect to
(i) any election under Accounting Standards Codification
825-10-25
(previously referred to as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 159) (or any other
Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary at “fair value,” as defined therein and (ii) any
treatment of Indebtedness in respect of convertible debt instruments under Accounting Standards Codification
470-20
(or any other Accounting Standards Codification or Financial Accounting Standard having a
similar result or effect) to value any such Indebtedness in a reduced or bifurcated manner as described therein, and such Indebtedness shall at all times be valued at the full stated principal amount thereof. If the Borrower notifies the
Administrative Agent that the Borrower (or its applicable Parent Company) is required to report under IFRS or has elected to do so through an early adoption policy, “GAAP” means international financial reporting standards pursuant to IFRS
(
provided
, that after such conversion, the Borrower cannot elect to report under GAAP).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, but subject to
Section
1.10
hereof, all financial ratios and tests (including the Total Leverage Ratio, the First Lien Leverage Ratio, the Secured Leverage Ratio, the Interest Coverage Ratio and the amount

Subject Transaction on a Pro Forma Basis. Further, if since the beginning of any such Test Period and on or prior to the date of any required calculation of any financial ratio or test (x) any Subject Transaction has occurred or (y) any
Person that subsequently became a Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the Borrower and/or any of its Subsidiaries or any joint venture since the beginning of such Test Period has consummated any Subject Transaction,
then, in each case, any applicable financial ratio or test shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis for such Test Period as if such Subject Transaction had occurred at the beginning of the applicable Test Period (or, in the case of Consolidated
Total Assets (or with respect to any determination pertaining to the balance sheet, including the acquisition of Cash and Cash Equivalents), as of the last day of such Test Period) (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that solely for
purposes of calculating actual compliance with
Section
6.15(a)
, the date of the required calculation shall be the last day of the Test Period, and no Subject Transaction occurring thereafter shall be taken into account).

of ASU
No. 2016-02
“Leases (Topic 842)” and ASU
No. 2018-11
“Leases (Topic 842)” shall be considered Capital Leases hereunder or under any
other Loan Document, and all calculations and deliverables under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made or prepared, as applicable, in accordance therewith;

extension.

specified transaction
”), in a currency other than Dollars, (i) the Dollar
Equivalent amount of a specified transaction in a currency other than Dollars shall be calculated based on the rate of exchange quoted by the Bloomberg Foreign Exchange Rates & World Currencies Page (or any successor page thereto, or in the
event such rate does not appear on any Bloomberg Page, by reference to such other publicly available service for displaying exchange rates as may be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders, acting
reasonably) and the Borrower) for such foreign currency, as in effect at 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the date of such specified transaction (which, in the case of any Restricted Payment, shall be deemed to be the date of the declaration thereof and,
in the case of the incurrence of Indebtedness, shall be deemed to be on the date first committed);
provided
, that if any Indebtedness is incurred (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) to refinance or replace other Indebtedness
denominated in a currency other than Dollars, and the relevant refinancing or replacement would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such
refinancing or replacement, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) does not exceed
an amount



71



sufficient to repay the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced or replaced, except by an amount equal to (x) unpaid accrued interest and premiums (including tender premiums)
thereon plus other reasonable and customary fees and expenses (including upfront fees and original issue discount) incurred in connection with such refinancing or replacement, (y) any existing commitments unutilized thereunder and
(z) additional amounts permitted to be incurred under
Section
6.01
and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in the rate of
currency exchange occurring after the time of any specified transaction so long as such specified transaction was permitted at the time incurred, made, acquired, committed, entered or declared as set forth in
clause (i)
. For purposes of

Section
6.15(a)
and calculating compliance with any financial ratio for purposes of taking any action hereunder, on any relevant date of determination, amounts denominated in currencies other than Dollars shall be
translated into Dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate used in preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to
Sections 5.01(a)
or
(b)
(or, prior to the first such delivery, the financial statements referred to in

Section
3.04
), as applicable, for the relevant Test Period and will, with respect to any Indebtedness, reflect the currency translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of any Hedge Agreement permitted hereunder
in respect of currency exchange risks with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination for the Dollar Equivalent amount of such Indebtedness;
provided
, that the amount of any Indebtedness that is subject to a
Debt FX Hedge shall be determined in accordance with the definition of “Consolidated Total Debt”.

(b) Each provision of this
Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders, acting reasonably) may from time to time specify with the Borrower’s consent to appropriately
reflect a change in currency of any country and any relevant market convention or practice relating to such change in currency.

Document, to the extent that any Lender agrees to extend the maturity date of, or replace, renew or refinance, any of its then-existing Loans with Incremental Loans, Replacement Term Loans, Extended Term Loans or loans incurred under a new credit
facility, in each case, to the extent such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing is effected by means of a “cashless roll” by such Lender, such extension, replacement, renewal or refinancing shall be deemed to comply with any
requirement hereunder or any other Loan Document that such payment be made “in Dollars”, “in immediately available funds”, “in Cash” or any other similar requirement.

Section 1.10

any Limited Condition Acquisition (including the assumption or incurrence of Indebtedness) and/or (B) the making of any Restricted Debt Payment, the determination of whether the relevant condition is satisfied may be made, at the election of
the Borrower, (1) in the case of any Limited Condition Acquisition (including with respect to any Indebtedness contemplated or incurred in connection therewith), at the time of (or on the basis of the financial statements for the most recently

6.15(a)
hereof, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any Interest Coverage Ratio test and/or the
amount of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets), such financial ratio or test shall be calculated at the time such action is taken (subject to
clause (a)
above), such change is made, such transaction is consummated
or such event occurs, as the case may be, and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in such financial ratio or test occurring after such calculation.

reliance on a provision of this Agreement that does not require compliance with a financial ratio or test (including, without limitation, any First Lien Leverage Ratio test, any Secured Leverage Ratio test, any Total Leverage Ratio test and/or any
Interest Coverage Ratio test) (any such amount, including any amount drawn under any revolving facility, a “
Fixed

provided in
clause (i)

Fixed Amount in its sole discretion;
provided
, that unless the Borrower elects otherwise and except as set forth in the definition of “Incremental Cap”, each such amount or transaction shall be deemed incurred, entered into or
consummated first under any Incurrence-Based Amount to the maximum extent permitted thereunder.

non-interest
bearing
Indebtedness or other discount security constituting Indebtedness at any date shall be the principal amount thereof that would be shown on a balance sheet of the Borrower dated such date prepared in accordance with GAAP.

interest or a dividend in the form of additional Indebtedness, amortization of original issue discount and/or any increase in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of any fluctuation in the exchange rate of any applicable
currency will not be deemed to be the granting of a Lien for purposes of
Section
6.02
.

(f) Whenever a financial
ratio or test is to be calculated on a pro forma basis (except with respect to (i) any calculation pursuant to
clause (d)
of the definition of “Incremental Cap” and (ii) any determination of actual compliance with

the definition thereof, or any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any
Benchmark Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, the Alternate Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark prior to its
discontinuance or unavailability, or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the
calculation of the Alternate Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the

this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether

Non-U.S.
Subsidiary, the relevant
Prepayment Asset Sale is consummated by any
Non-U.S.
Subsidiary or the relevant Net Insurance/Condemnation Proceeds are received by any
Non-U.S.
Subsidiary, as the case
may be, for so long as the repatriation to the Borrower of any such amount would be, in the good faith determination of the Borrower, prohibited or delayed under any Requirement of Law or conflict with the fiduciary duties of such
Non-U.S.
Subsidiary’s directors, or result in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any officer, director, employee, manager, member of management
or consultant of such
Non-U.S.
Subsidiary (it being understood and agreed that (i) solely within 365 days following the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period or the event giving rise to the
relevant Subject Proceeds, the Borrower shall take all commercially reasonable actions required by applicable Requirements of Law to permit such repatriation and (ii) if the repatriation of the relevant affected Excess Cash Flow or Subject
Proceeds, as the case may be, is permitted under the applicable Requirement of Law and, to the extent applicable, would no longer conflict with the fiduciary duties of such director, or result in, or be reasonably expected to result in, a material
risk of personal or criminal liability for the Persons described above, in either case, within 365 days following the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period or the event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds, the relevant
Non-U.S.
Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, and the repatriated Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, will be promptly (and
in any event not later than two Business Days after such repatriation) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against such Excess Cash Flow or such Subject Proceeds as a result thereof) to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to
this
Section
2.11(b)
to the extent required herein (without regard to this
clause (v)
)),

(B) the Borrower shall not be required to prepay any amount that would otherwise be required to be paid pursuant to
Sections
2.11(b)(i)
or
(ii)
to the extent that the relevant Excess Cash Flow is generated by any joint venture or the relevant Subject Proceeds are received by any joint venture, in each case, for so long as the distribution to the Borrower
of such Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds would, in the good faith determination of the Borrower, be prohibited under the Organizational Documents governing such joint venture; it being understood that if the relevant prohibition ceases to exist
within the
365-day
period following the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period or the event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds, the relevant joint venture will promptly distribute the relevant
Excess Cash Flow or the relevant Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, and the distributed Excess Cash Flow or Subject Proceeds, as the case may be, will be promptly (and in any event not later than two Business Days after such distribution) applied
to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to this
Section

intercompany distribution) to the Borrower, directly or indirectly, from a
Non-U.S.
Subsidiary as a distribution or dividend of any amounts required to mandatorily prepay the Term Loans pursuant to
Sections
2.11(b)(i)
or
(ii)
above would result in the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries incurring a material Tax liability (including any withholding Tax) (such amount, a “
Restricted Amount
”), the amount that the Borrower
shall be required to mandatorily prepay pursuant to
Sections 2.11(b)(i)
or
(ii)
above, as applicable, shall be reduced by the Restricted Amount;
provided
, that to the extent that the repatriation (or other intercompany
distribution) of the relevant Subject Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, directly or indirectly, from the relevant
Non-U.S.
Subsidiary would no longer have a material tax consequence within the 365 day period
following the event giving rise to the relevant Subject Proceeds or the end of the applicable Excess Cash Flow Period, as the case may be, an amount equal to the Subject Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, as applicable and to the extent available, not
previously applied pursuant to this
clause (C)
, shall be promptly applied to the repayment of the Term Loans pursuant to
Section
2.11(b)
as otherwise required above;

(vi) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent in writing of any prepayment under this
Section
2.11(b)
not
later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) four (4) Business Days before the date of prepayment (or such shorter period of notice as the Administrative Agent may reasonably agree); it being understood that any such notice may be revocable by the
Borrower. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to any Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Lenders of the contents thereof. Any Term Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent at or prior to
three (3) Business Days prior to any prepayment of Term Loans required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to this
Section
2.11(b)
or any prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to
Section
2.11(a)
to the
extent in reliance on the proviso to
Section
2.12(c)
, to decline all (but not a portion) of its Applicable Percentage of such prepayment (such declined amounts, the “
Declined Proceeds
”), in which case such
Declined Proceeds may be retained by the Borrower and shall be applied to increase the Available Amount;
provided
, that for the avoidance of doubt, no Lender may reject any prepayment made under
Section
2.11(b)(iii)

above to the extent that such prepayment is made with the Net Proceeds of (w) Refinancing Indebtedness (including Replacement Debt) incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to
Section
6.01(p)
,
(x) Incremental Loans incurred to refinance all or a portion of the Term Loans pursuant to

requirements of
Section
9.02(c)
and/or (z) Incremental Equivalent Debt incurred to finance all or a portion of the Loans in accordance with the requirements of
Section
6.01(z)
. If any Lender
fails to deliver a notice to the Administrative Agent of its election to decline receipt of its Applicable Percentage of any mandatory prepayment within the time frame specified by the Administrative Agent, such failure will be deemed to constitute
an acceptance of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of Term Loans.

(vii) Except as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or provided in, or intended with respect to, any Refinancing Amendment, any Incremental Facility Amendment, any Extension Amendment or any issuance of Replacement Debt (
provided
, that such Refinancing
Amendment, Incremental Facility Amendment or Extension Amendment may not provide that the applicable Class of Term Loans receive a greater than pro rata portion of mandatory prepayments of Term Loans pursuant to

Section
2.11(b)
than would otherwise be permitted by this Agreement), in each case, effectuated or issued in a manner consistent with this Agreement, each prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to
Sections 2.11(b)(i)
,

,
(iii)
and
(iv)

provided
, that
any prepayment of Term Loans with the Net Proceeds of any Refinancing Indebtedness, Incremental Facility or Replacement Term Loans shall be applied to the applicable Class of Term Loans being refinanced or replaced). With respect to each
relevant Class of Term Loans, all accepted prepayments under



85



this
Section
2.11(b)
shall be applied against the remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect of such Term Loans as directed by the Borrower (or, in the
absence of direction from the Borrower, to the remaining scheduled amortization payments in respect of such Term Loans in direct order of maturity), and each such prepayment shall be paid to the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentage of the applicable Class. If no Lenders exercise the right to waive a prepayment of the Term Loans pursuant to
Section
2.11(b)(vi)
, the amount of such mandatory prepayments shall be applied first to the
then outstanding Term Loans that are ABR Loans to the full extent thereof and then to the then outstanding Term Loans that are SOFR Loans in a manner that minimizes the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower pursuant to

Section
2.16
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent is not responsible for minimizing the amount of any payments required to be made by the Borrower or otherwise determining the
application of any prepayment amounts and shall be solely responsible for applying such amounts as directed by the Borrower.

the Administrative Agent shall have no duty to perform any calculations) hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

Section 2.13
Interest
.

(a) The Term Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate.

(b) The Term Loans comprising each SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at Term SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing

plus
the Applicable Rate.

(c) [Reserved].

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing but in all cases subject to
Section
9.05(f)
, if an Event of Default exists pursuant
to
Sections 7.01(a)
,
(f)
or (g), and any principal of or interest on any Term Loan or any fee or premium payable by the Borrower hereunder is not, in each case, paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise,
the relevant overdue amount shall bear interest, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal or interest of any Term
Loan, 2.00%
plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Term Loan, as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this
Section
2.13
or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2.00%
plus
the rate applicable to Term
Loans that are ABR Loans as provided in
Section
2.13(a)

360-day
year and actual days
elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a
365-day
year). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Term SOFR shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or
such portion is paid;

Section 2.14
Alternate Rate of Interest; Benchmark Replacement Settings
.

(a) Subject to
Section
2.14(b)
hereof, if prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a SOFR Borrowing:

(i) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (who shall provide notice thereof to the Administrative Agent) determine (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Term SOFR for such Interest Period; or

(ii) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Term SOFR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by electronic mail or, in the case of the Lenders, by posting
to the Platform as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as applicable, notifies the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (if applicable) and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to
such notice no longer exist, which the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, as applicable, agree to do promptly, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain SOFR Loans in the affected currency or currencies shall be suspended and
(y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Alternate Base Rate shall be suspended. Upon
receipt of such notice, (1) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or, (2) failing that, the Borrower will
be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of ABR Loans (subject to the foregoing
clause (y)
) in the amount specified therein;
provided
,
however
, that if no such election is made by the Borrower
within three days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected
clause (1)
above. Upon any such conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted, together with any
additional amounts required pursuant to
Section
2.16
. Subject to
Section
2.14(b)
, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error)
that “Term SOFR” cannot be determined pursuant to the definition thereof on any given day, the interest rate on ABR Loans shall be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to clause (c) of the definition of
“Alternate Base Rate” until the Administrative Agent revokes such determination.



88



(b)
Benchmark Replacement Setting
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or
in any other Loan Document:

(i)
Benchmark Replacement
.

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its
related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with
clause (a)
of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement”
for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or
further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with
clause (b)
of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for
such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5
th
) Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other
Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is based upon Daily Simple SOFR,
all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.

(B) No Hedge Agreement shall constitute a “Loan
Document” for purposes of this
Section
2.14(b)
.

(ii)
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes
. In
connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders), in consultation with the Borrower, will have the right to make Benchmark
Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any further
action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection with the
use or administration of Term SOFR.

(iii)
Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations
. The Administrative Agent (acting at
the direction of the Required Lenders) will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection with
the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) or, if applicable, any Lender (or
group of Lenders) pursuant to this
Section
2.14(b)
, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment, implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, the timing of implementation of
any Benchmark Replacement or of the occurrence or
non-occurrence
of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding
absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this

Section
2.14(b), and shall not be a basis of any claim of liability of any

kind or nature by any party hereto, all such claims being hereby waived individually by each party hereto
.



89



(iv)
Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor
for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders in their reasonable discretion) or
(B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent
(acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or
non-representative
tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a
Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the
Required Lenders) may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

(v)
Benchmark Unavailability Period
. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability
Period, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to
have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans. During a Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the
Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate.

Section 2.15
Increased Costs
.

(a) If any Change in Law:

(i)
imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in Term SOFR);

(ii) subjects any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes and (B) Excluded Taxes) on or with respect to its loans, letters
of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or

(iii)
imposes on any Lender or the applicable interbank market any other condition (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by any Lender;



90



and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the relevant Lender of making or
maintaining any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of any SOFR Loan in an
amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, within 30 days after the Borrower’s receipt of the certificate contemplated by
paragraph (c)
of this Section, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts
as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered;
provided
, that the Borrower shall not be liable for such compensation if (x) the relevant Change in Law occurs on a date prior to the date such
Lender becomes a party hereto, (y) such Lender invokes
Section
2.20
or (z) in the case of any requests for reimbursement under
clause (iii)
above resulting from a market disruption, (A) the
relevant circumstances do not generally affect the banking market or (B) the applicable request has not been made by Lenders constituting Required Lenders.

(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding liquidity or capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such or such Lender’s holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law other than due to Taxes (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then within 30 days
of receipt by the Borrower of the certificate contemplated by
paragraph (c)
of this
Section
2.15
the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c) Any Lender requesting compensation under this

Section
2.15
shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Borrower that (i) sets forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the holding company thereof, as applicable, as specified in

paragraph (a)
or
(b)
of this
Section
2.15
, (ii) sets forth, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (iii) certifies that such Lender is generally charging such
amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d) Failure or delay on the part of
any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation;
provided
,
however
, that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender
pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s
intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
,
further
, that if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
180-day
period referred to above
shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

Section 2.16
Break Funding Payments
. Subject to

Section
9.05(f)
, in the event of (a) the conversion or prepayment of any principal of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
reason of acceleration or otherwise), (b) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any SOFR Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (c) the assignment of any SOFR Loan of any Lender other
than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section
2.19
, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the actual amount of
any actual
out-of-pocket
loss, expense and/or liability (including any loss, expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or
other funds required by such Lender to fund or maintain SOFR Loans, but excluding loss of anticipated profit) that such Lender may



91



incur or sustain as a result of such event. Any Lender requesting compensation under this
Section
2.16
shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Borrower that
(A) sets forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, the basis therefor and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were determined and (B) certifies that such
Lender is generally charging the relevant amounts to similarly situated borrowers, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days after
receipt thereof.

Section 2.17
Taxes
.

(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Requirements of Law. If any applicable Requirement of Law requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) if such Tax is an Indemnified
Tax and/or Other Tax, the amount payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after all required deductions or withholdings have been made (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this

Section
2.17
) each Lender (or, in the case of any payment made to the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or
withholdings been made, (ii) the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) the applicable withholding agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law.

(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law or, at the option of the Administrative Agent, timely reimburse it for the payment of any Other Taxes.

(c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender within 30 days after receipt of the certificate described in the
succeeding sentence, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as applicable (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section
2.17
), and, in each case, any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not correctly or legally imposed or asserted; provided, that if the Borrower reasonably believes that such Taxes were not correctly or legally asserted, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to obtain a refund of such Taxes (which shall be repaid to the Borrower in accordance with
Section
2.17(g)
) so long as such efforts would not, in the reasonable
determination of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, result in any additional
out-of-pocket
costs or expenses not reimbursed by the Borrower or be otherwise
materially disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable. In connection with any request for reimbursement under this
Section
2.17(c)
, the relevant Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis and calculation of the amount of the relevant payment or liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

Section
2.17
, the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to this
Section
2.17
for any amount to the extent the Administrative Agent or such
Lender fails to notify the Borrower of such possible indemnification claim within 180 days after the Administrative Agent or such Lender receives written notice from the applicable taxing authority of the specific tax assessment giving rise to such
indemnification claim.



92



(d) [Reserved].

(e) As soon as practicable after any payment of any Taxes pursuant to this
Section
2.17
by the Borrower to a
Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence
of such payment that is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

(f)
Status of Lenders
.

(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any withholding Tax with respect to any payments made under any Loan
Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation as the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent may reasonably request to permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup
withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
paragraphs
(f)(ii)(A)
,
(ii)(B)
and
(ii)(D)
of this
Section
2.17
) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to deliver to the Borrower and to any successor Administrative Agent any documentation
provided to the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section
2.17(f)
.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,

(A) each U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such U.S. Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form
W-9
certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding;

(B) each
Foreign Lender, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter
upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

(1)
in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the U.S. is a party, executed copies of IRS Form W- 8BEN or
W-8BEN-E,
as
applicable, establishing any available exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax;



93



(2) executed copies of IRS Form

W-8ECI
(or any successor forms);

(3) in the case of any Foreign Lender claiming
the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, (x) two executed copies of a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit
J-1
to the effect that
such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled
foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and that no payments payable to such Lender are effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business (a “
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
”)
and (y) executed copies of IRS Form
W-8BEN
or
W-8BEN-E,
as applicable (or any successor forms); or

(4) to the extent any Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (
e.g.
, where the Foreign Lender is a partnership),
executed copies of IRS Form
W-8IMY
(or any successor forms), accompanied by IRS Form
W-8ECI,
IRS Form
W-8EXP,
IRS Form
W-8BEN
or
W-8BEN-E,
a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit

J-2
,
or Exhibit
J-4
, IRS Form
W-9,
and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;

provided
, that if such Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating Lender) and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S.
Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit
J-3
on behalf of each such direct or indirect partner(s);

(C) each Foreign Lender, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two executed copies of any other form
prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law
to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

(D)
if a payment made to any Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in
Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law and at such time or times reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation as is prescribed by applicable Requirements of Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the
Borrower or



94



Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA, to determine whether such Lender has complied with such
Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (D)
, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this
Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, if a Lender is an entity disregarded from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
references to the foregoing documentation are intended to refer to documentation with respect to such Lender’s owner and, as applicable, such Lender.

Each Lender agrees that if any documentation (including any specific documentation required above in this

Section
2.17(f)
) it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section
2.17(f)
, no Lender shall be required to provide any
documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.

(g) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund (whether received in cash or applied as a credit against any cash taxes payable) of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with
respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section
2.17
, it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the
Borrower under this
Section
2.17
with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket

expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (including any Taxes imposed with respect to such refund), and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
,
that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (
plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
paragraph (g)
, in no event will the
Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph (g)
to the extent that the payment thereof would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a less favorable net
after-Tax
position than the position that the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have been in if such Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise
imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This
Section
2.17(g)
shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available
its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

(h)

Survival
. Each party’s obligations under this
Section
2.17
shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender, the
termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.



95



(i)
Administrative Agent Documentation
. On or before the Restatement Date, the
Administrative Agent shall (and any successor or replacement Administrative Agent shall on or before the date on which it becomes the Administrative Agent hereunder) deliver to the Borrower duly executed copies of either (i) IRS Form
W-9
or (ii) IRS Form

(with respect to any payments to be received on its own behalf) and IRS Form
W-8IMY
(for all other
payments), establishing that the Borrower can make payments to the Administrative Agent without deduction or withholding of any Taxes imposed by the U.S., including Taxes imposed under FATCA.

Section 2.18
Payments Generally; Allocation of Proceeds; Sharing of Payments
.

(a) Unless otherwise specified, the Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
fees or of amounts payable under
Section
2.15
,
2.16
or
2.17
, or otherwise) prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date when due, in Same Day Funds, without

set-off
or counterclaim. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee
shall continue to accrue. Each such payment shall be made to the Administrative Agent to the applicable account designated by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower, except that any payment made pursuant to
Sections 2.15
,
2.16
,

2.17
or
9.03
shall be made directly to the Person or Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payment received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
following receipt thereof. Except as provided in
Sections

2.19(b)
and
2.21
, each Borrowing, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Borrowing, each payment of interest in respect of the Loans of a given Class and
each conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Borrowing of any Type (and of the same Class) shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages of the applicable
Class. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender’s portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, round each Lender’s percentage of such Borrowing to the next higher or lower whole
Dollar amount. Subject to
Section
1.09
, all payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the
Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such
payment.

(b) Subject in all respects to the provisions of each applicable Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds of Collateral and any
proceeds realized with respect to guarantees by the Borrower received by the Administrative Agent while an Event of Default exists and all or any portion of the Loans have been accelerated hereunder pursuant to

Section
7.01
, shall be applied,
first
, to the payment of all fees, costs and expenses then due incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any collection, sale or realization on Collateral or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any of the Secured Obligations, including all court costs and the fees and expenses of the Administrative Agent’s agents and legal counsel, the repayment of all advances made by the
Administrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document on behalf of the Borrower and any other costs or expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document,
second
, on a
pro rata basis, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements then due to the Administrative Agent (other than those covered in clause first above) from the Borrower constituting Secured Obligations,
third
, on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the amounts of the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has yet been made) owed to the Secured Parties on the date of any such distribution, to the payment in full of the Secured
Obligations,
fourth
, as provided in each applicable Intercreditor Agreement, and
fifth
, to, or at the direction of, the Borrower or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.

(c) If any Lender obtains payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of
set-off
or otherwise) in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans of any Class held by it resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the
aggregate amount of its Loans of such Class and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender with Loans of such Class, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for Cash at face value)
participations in the Loans of other Lenders of such Class at such time outstanding to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders of such Class ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans of such Class;
provided
, that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to (A) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
express terms of this Agreement or (B) any payment obtained by any Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any permitted assignee or participant, including any payment made or deemed made
in connection with
Sections 2.22
,
2.23
,
9.02(c)
and/or
Section
9.05
. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable Requirements of Law, that
any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise rights of
set-off
and counterclaim against the Borrower with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this

Section
2.18(c)
and will, in each case, notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this
Section
2.18(c)
shall from and
after the date of such purchase have the right to give all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though the purchasing
Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date
in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lender the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each Lender severally agrees to repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of
(i) the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date in a Borrowing Request of any Borrowing
of SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of ABR Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.03
. If any Lender fails to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section
2.07(b)
or

Section
2.18(d)
, then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to
satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.



97



Section 2.19
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.

(a) If any Lender requests compensation under
Section
2.15
or determines it can no longer make or maintain SOFR Loans
pursuant to
Section
2.20
, or the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section
2.17
,
then such Lender shall (at the request of the Borrower) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder, or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section
2.15
or
2.17
, as applicable, in the future or
mitigate the impact of
Section
2.20
, as the case may be, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed
out-of-pocket
cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender in any material respect. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
out-of-pocket
costs and
expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(b) If (i) any Lender requests compensation
under
Section
2.15
or determines it can no longer make or maintain SOFR Loans pursuant to
Section
2.20
, (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to or indemnify any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section
2.17
, (iii) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or (iv) in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent requiring the consent of
“each Lender” or “each Lender directly affected thereby” (or any other Class or group of Lenders other than the Required Lenders) with respect to which Required Lender consent (or the consent of Lenders holding loans or
commitments of such Class or lesser group representing more than 50% of the sum of the total loans and unused commitments of such Class or lesser group at such time) has been obtained, as applicable, any Lender is a
non-consenting
Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, (x) terminate the applicable Commitments of such Lender, and repay all
Obligations of the Borrower owing to such Lender relating to the applicable Loans and participations held by such Lender as of such termination date or (y) replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to assign and delegate (and such Lender
shall be obligated to assign and delegate), without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section
9.05
), all of its interests, rights and obligations (other than its existing rights to
payments pursuant to
Section
2.15
or
Section
2.17
) under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which Eligible Assignee may be another Lender, if any Lender
accepts such assignment);
provided
, that (A) such Lender has received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of its Loans of such Class of Loans and/or Commitments (including, if applicable, any amount owing
pursuant to
Section
2.12(c)
), accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it under any Loan Document with respect to such Class of Loans and/or Commitments, (B) in the case of any
assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section
2.15
or payment required to be made pursuant to
Section
2.17
, such assignment would result in a reduction in such compensation or
payment, (C) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a
non-consenting
Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent, and
(D) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Requirements of Law. No Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) shall be required to make any such assignment and delegation, and the Borrower may not repay the Obligations of such Lender or
terminate its Commitments, in each case, if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. Each Lender agrees that if it is



98



replaced pursuant to this
Section
2.19
, it shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment Agreement to evidence such sale and purchase and deliver
to the Borrower any Promissory Note (if the assigning Lender’s Loans are evidenced by one or more Promissory Notes) subject to such Assignment Agreement (
provided
, that the failure of any Lender replaced pursuant to this

Section
2.19
to execute an Assignment Agreement or deliver any such Promissory Note shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment) invalid), such assignment shall be recorded in the Register and
any such Promissory Note shall be deemed cancelled. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such Lender’s
attorney-in-fact,
with full authority in the place and stead of such Lender and in the name of such Lender, with prior written notice to such Lender, to execute any such Assignment Agreement, at the
instruction of the Borrower, to carry out the provisions of this
clause (b)
, and the Administrative Agent shall have no liability for any action so taken pursuant to such appointment and the instruction of the Borrower.

Section 2.20
Illegality
. If any Lender reasonably determines that any Change in Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental
Authority has asserted after the Closing Date that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to Term SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates
based upon Term SOFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of Dollars in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to
the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue SOFR Loans or to convert ABR Loans to SOFR Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making
or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender, shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by
such Lender without reference to Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case, until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist (which
notice such Lender agrees to give promptly). Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from the relevant Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at its election prepay or convert all of such Lender’s SOFR
Loans to ABR Loans (the interest rate on which ABR Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by such Lender without reference to Term SOFR component of the Alternate Base Rate) either on the last day of the
Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans (in which case the Borrower shall not be required to make
payments pursuant to
Section
2.16
in connection with such payment) and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent
shall during the period of such suspension compute the Alternate Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal
for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will not, in the determination of such Lender, otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

Section 2.21
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Person becomes a
Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Person is a Defaulting Lender to the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law:

(a) [Reserved].



99



(b) The Loans and the Commitments of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether all Lenders, each affected Lender, the Required Lenders or such other number of Lenders as may be required hereby or under any other Loan Document have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any waiver,
amendment or modification pursuant to
Section
9.02
);
provided
, that any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender which affects such Defaulting Lender
disproportionately and adversely relative to other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender. In determining whether the Administrative Agent shall be protected in relying upon any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other communication, only Loans and Commitments that a Responsible Officer of the Administrative Agent actually knows to be held by a Defaulting Lender shall be so disregarded.

(c) Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of any Defaulting Lender
(whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Section
2.11
,
Section
2.15
,
Section
2.16
,
Section
2.17
,

Section
2.18
,
Article 7
,
Section
9.05
or otherwise, and including any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to

Section
9.09
), shall be applied as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amount owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists,
as the Borrower may request, to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement;
third
, as the Required Lenders or the Borrower may elect, to be held in a
deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement;
fourth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the
non-Defaulting

Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any
non-Defaulting
Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement;
fifth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such
Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
sixth
, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to any
Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by any Defaulting Lender or to post Cash collateral pursuant to this
Section
2.21
(c) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and
each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(d) In the event that the Required Lenders and the Borrower agree that any Defaulting Lender has
adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, the Required Lenders will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein
(which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash collateral), then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders or participations in Loans or take such other actions as the Required Lenders and/or the
Borrower determine are necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans or participations in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the fact that any Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such
Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, (x) no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender and (y) except to the extent otherwise
expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

Section 2.22
Incremental Credit Extensions
.

(a) The Borrower may, at any time, on one or more occasions pursuant to an Incremental Facility Amendment add one or more new Classes of term
facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the Term Loans of any existing Class by requesting new commitments to provide such Term Loans (any such new Class or increase, an “
Incremental Facility
” and any loans made
pursuant to an Incremental Facility, “
Incremental Loans
”) in an aggregate outstanding principal amount not to exceed the Incremental Cap;
provided
, that:

(i) no Incremental Commitment in respect of any Incremental Facility may be in an amount that is less than $5,000,000 (or such lesser amount
to which the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) may reasonably agree),

(ii) except as the Borrower
and any Lender may separately agree, no Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental Commitment, and the determination to provide any Incremental Commitment shall be within the sole and absolute discretion of such Lender;

that (A) so long as the Initial Lenders and their respective Affiliates, collectively, hold at least 50.1%, but none of such Initial Lenders, together with its respective Affiliates, individually hold at least 50.1%, in each case, of the then
outstanding Term Loans at the time the Borrower elects to implement any Incremental Facility, prior to entering into definitive documentation with respect to any Incremental Facility, the Borrower shall have first provided the Initial Lenders with a
reasonable opportunity to collectively propose terms with respect to such Incremental Facility or (B) so long as BXCI holds at least 50.1% of the then outstanding Term Loans at the time the Borrower elects to implement any Incremental Facility,
prior to entering into definitive documentation with respect to any Incremental Facility, the Borrower shall have first provided BXCI with a reasonable opportunity to propose terms with respect to such Incremental Facility (it being understood that
if the Borrower does not elect to pursue any Incremental Facility on the terms initially offered by any Initial Lenders or their affiliates pursuant to this
clause (ii)
, the Borrower shall not be required to make any subsequent offer to such
Initial Lenders or their Affiliates),

(iii) no Incremental Facility or Incremental Loan (nor the creation, provision or implementation
thereof) shall require the approval of any existing Lender other than in its capacity, if any, as a lender providing all or part of any Incremental Commitment or Incremental Loan,

(iv) except as otherwise permitted herein (including with respect to margin, pricing, maturity and fees), (A) the terms of any Incremental
Facility, may not be materially more favorable (taken as a whole) to the relevant Incremental Lenders than the terms of the Initial Term Loans, unless such terms are acceptable to the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required
Lenders, acting reasonably)) (it being agreed that any terms contained in such Incremental Facility that are (x) applicable only after the then-existing Latest Maturity Date, (y) more favorable to the lenders or the agent of such
Incremental Facility than those contained in the Loan Documents and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Term Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, pursuant to the applicable Incremental Facility
Amendment and/or (z) consistent with current market terms and conditions (taken as a whole) at the time of incurrence or issuance (as determined by the Borrower in good faith), shall, in each case, be deemed acceptable to the Administrative
Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders)) and (B) any Incremental Facility that consists of Customary Term A Loans may include one or more financial maintenance covenants that do not apply for the benefit of any Lender that does
not hold such Customary Term A Loans,



101



(v) the Effective Yield (and the components thereof) applicable to any Incremental Facility
shall be determined by the Borrower and the lender or lenders providing such Incremental Facility;
provided
, that (A) the Effective Yield applicable to any Incremental Facility that constitutes MFN Indebtedness may not be more than 0.50%
higher than the Effective Yield applicable to the Initial Term Loans, unless the Applicable Rate (and/or, as provided in the proviso below, the Alternate Base Rate floor or Term SOFR floor) with respect to the Initial Term Loans is adjusted such
that the Effective Yield on the Initial Term Loans is not more than 0.50% per annum less than the Effective Yield with respect to such Incremental Facility and (B) any increase in Effective Yield applicable to any Initial Term Loan due to the
application or imposition of an Alternate Base Rate floor or Term SOFR floor on any Incremental Loan may, at the election of the Borrower, be effected through an increase in the Alternate Base Rate floor or Term SOFR floor applicable to such Initial
Term Loan (this proviso, the “
MFN

Provision
”),

(vi) the final maturity date with respect to any Incremental Loans
(other than Customary Bridge Loans or Customary Term A Loans) shall be no earlier than the Latest Maturity Date,

clauses (vi)
and
(vii)
above, any Incremental Facility may otherwise have an amortization schedule as
determined by the Borrower and the lenders providing such Incremental Facility,

(ix) subject to
clause (v)
above, to the
extent applicable, any fees payable in connection with any Incremental Facility shall be determined by the Borrower and the arrangers and/or lenders providing such Incremental Facility,

(x) (A) any Incremental Facility may rank
pari passu
with or junior to any then-existing Class of Term Loans in right of payment
and/or security or may be unsecured (and to the extent the relevant Incremental Facility is secured, it shall be subject to an Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement) and (B) no Incremental Facility may be (x) guaranteed by any Person (it
being understood that the obligations of any Person with respect to any escrow arrangement into which such Incremental Facility proceeds are deposited shall not constitute a guarantee) or (y) secured by any assets other than the Collateral
(other than with respect to proceeds of such Incremental Facility that are subject to (and only for so long as they are subject to) an escrow or other similar arrangements and any related deposit of Cash or Cash Equivalents to cover interest and
premium with respect to such Incremental Facility),

(xi) any Incremental Facility may participate (A) in any voluntary prepayment of
Term Loans as set forth in
Section
2.11(a)(i)
and (B) in any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in
Section
2.11(b)(vii)
, in each case, to the extent provided in such Sections;

provided
, that, any Incremental Facility may participate (1) in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans on a pro rata basis, greater than pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis with the then-outstanding Term Loans, and (2) in any
mandatory prepayment, on a pro rata basis (to the extent secured on a
pari passu
basis with the Initial Term Loans) or less than pro rata basis with the then-outstanding Credit Facility (and on a greater than pro rata basis with respect to
any prepayment of any such Incremental Loans with the proceeds of any Refinancing Indebtedness or any Incremental Facility incurred in reliance on
clause (b)
of the Incremental Cap),



102



(xii) (A) subject to
Section
1.10(a)
, except as otherwise agreed
by the lenders providing the relevant Incremental Facility in connection with an acquisition or similar Investment permitted under this Agreement, no Event of Default shall exist immediately prior to or after giving effect to such Incremental
Facility and (B) no Event of Default under
Sections 7.01(a)

(xiii) the proceeds of any Incremental Facility may be used for working capital and/or other general corporate purposes (including Capital
Expenditures, acquisitions, Investments, Restricted Payments and Restricted Debt Payments and related fees and expenses) and any other use not prohibited by this Agreement, and

(xiv) on the date of the Borrowing of any Incremental Loans that will be of the same Class as any then-existing Class of Term Loans,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Sections 2.08
or
2.13
above, such Incremental Loans shall be added to (and constitute a part of, be of the same Type as and, at the election of the Borrower, have the same
Interest Period as) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans of such Class on a pro rata basis (based on the relative sizes of such Borrowings), so that each Term Lender providing such Incremental Loans will participate proportionately in each
then- outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans of such Class; it being acknowledged that the application of this
clause (a)(xiv)(B)
may result in new Incremental Loans having Interest Periods (the duration of which may be less than one month) that
begin during an Interest Period then applicable to outstanding SOFR Loans of the relevant Class and which end on the last day of such Interest Period.

(b) Incremental Commitments may be provided by any existing Lender, or by any other Eligible Assignee (any such other lender being called an
“
Incremental Lender
”);
provided
, that the Administrative Agent shall have a right to consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the relevant Incremental Lender’s provision of Incremental
Commitments if such consent would be required under
Section
9.05(b)
for an assignment of Loans to such Incremental Lender;
provided
,
further
, that any Incremental Lender that is an Affiliated Lender shall be
subject to the provisions of
Section
9.05(g)
,
mutatis mutandis
, to the same extent as if the relevant Incremental Commitments and related Obligations had been acquired by such Lender by way of assignment.

(c) Each Lender or Incremental Lender providing a portion of any Incremental Commitment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower all such documentation (including the relevant Incremental Facility Amendment) as may be reasonably required by the Administrative Agent to evidence and effectuate such Incremental Commitment. On the effective date of such
Incremental Commitment, each Incremental Lender shall become a Lender for all purposes in connection with this Agreement.

(d) As
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of any Incremental Facility or the making of any Incremental Loans, (i) upon its request or at the request of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive customary
written opinions of counsel, as well as such reaffirmation agreements, supplements and/or amendments as it shall reasonably require, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, from each Incremental Lender, an Administrative
Questionnaire and such other documents as it shall reasonably require from such Incremental Lender, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received, on behalf of the Incremental Lenders, the amount of any fees payable to the Incremental
Lenders in respect of such Incremental Facility or Incremental Loans, (iv) subject to
Section
2.22(f)
, the Administrative Agent shall have received a Borrowing Request as if the relevant Incremental Loans were subject
to
Section
2.03
or another written request the form of which is reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent (it being understood and agreed that the requirement to deliver a Borrowing Request shall not result in the
imposition of any additional condition precedent to the availability of the relevant Incremental Loans) and (v) the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive a certificate of the Borrower signed by a Responsible Officer thereof:



103



(A) certifying and attaching a copy of the resolutions adopted by the
governing body of the Borrower approving or consenting to such Incremental Facility or Incremental Loans, and

(B) to the
extent applicable, certifying that the condition set forth in
Section
2.22(a)(xii)
above has been satisfied.

(e)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to confirm or otherwise ascertain whether any conditions precedent to the effectiveness of any Incremental Facility or the making of any Incremental
Loans or the execution of any Incremental Facility Amendment have been satisfied and shall incur no liability in connection with executing any Incremental Facility Amendment.

(f) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any Incremental Facility Amendment and/or any amendment to
any other Loan Document as may be necessary in order to establish new Classes or
sub-Classes
in respect of Loans or commitments pursuant to this
Section
2.22
and such technical
amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with the establishment of such new Classes or
sub-Classes,
in each case, on terms consistent with this
Section
2.22

and

above, any Extended Term Loans may otherwise have an amortization schedule as
determined by the Borrower and the Lenders providing such Extended Term Loans,

(vi) any Class of Extended Term Loans may participate
(A) in any voluntary prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in
Section
2.11(a)(i)
and (B) in any mandatory prepayment of Term Loans as set forth in
Section
2.11(b)(vii)
, in each case, to

satisfied or waived by the Borrower; and



105



(x) any documentation in respect of any Extension shall be consistent with the foregoing.

shall be adjusted to give effect to any Extension of any Class of Loans and/or Commitments and (iii) except as set forth in
Section

above, no Extension Offer is
required to be in any minimum amount or any minimum increment;
provided

Minimum Extension Condition
”) to the consummation of any Extension that a minimum
amount (to be specified in the relevant Extension Offer in the Borrower’s sole discretion) of Loans or Commitments (as applicable) of any or all applicable tranches be tendered; it being understood that the Borrower may, in its sole discretion,
waive any such Minimum Extension Condition. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby consent to the transactions contemplated by this
Section

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of any interest,
fees or premium in respect of any Extended Term Loans on such terms as may be set forth in the relevant Extension Offer) and hereby waive the requirements of any provision of this Agreement (including
Sections 2.10
,

and/or

2.18
) or any other Loan Document that may otherwise prohibit any such Extension or any other transaction contemplated by this Section.

(c) No consent of any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall be required to effectuate any Extension, other than the consent of each Lender
agreeing to such Extension with respect to one or more of its Loans and/or Commitments of any Class (or a portion thereof). All Extended Term Loans and all obligations in respect thereof shall constitute Secured Obligations under this Agreement and

pari passu
basis with all other applicable Secured Obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the
Administrative Agent to enter into any Extension Amendment and any amendments to any of the other Loan Documents with the Borrower as may be necessary in order to establish new Classes or

in respect of Loans or Commitments administratively feasible for the Administrative
Agent.

such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent) prior written notice thereof, and shall agree to such procedures (including regarding timing, rounding and other adjustments and to ensure reasonable administrative management of the
credit facilities hereunder after such Extension), if any, as may be reasonably established by, or reasonably acceptable to, the Administrative Agent to accomplish the purposes of this
Section

Article 7
), upon the failure by the Borrower to comply with
Section
6.15(a)
above for any Fiscal Quarter, the Borrower shall have the right (the “
Cure Right
”) (at any time during such
Fiscal Quarter or thereafter until the date that is 15 Business Days after the date on which financial statements for such Fiscal Quarter are required to be delivered pursuant to
Section
5.01(a)
or
(b)
, as
applicable) to issue Qualified Capital Stock or other equity (such other equity to be on terms acceptable to the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders, acting reasonably)) for Cash or otherwise receive Cash
contributions in respect of its Qualified Capital Stock (the “
Cure Amount

Section
6.15(a)
shall be recalculated giving effect to a pro forma increase in
the amount of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA by an amount equal to the Cure Amount (notwithstanding the absence of a related addback in the definition of “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA”) solely for the purpose of determining compliance with

that had occurred (or would
have occurred) shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in each four consecutive Fiscal Quarter period there shall be at least two Fiscal Quarters (it being understood that,

(iii) for purposes of calculating Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount required for the purpose of complying with
Section
6.15(a)
, (iv) there shall be no pro forma or other
reduction of the amount of Indebtedness by the amount of any Cure Amount for purposes of determining compliance with
Section
6.15(a)
for the Fiscal Quarter in respect of which the Cure Right was exercised (other than, with
respect to any future period, to the extent of any portion of such Cure Amount that is actually applied to repay Indebtedness) and (v) during any Test Period in which any Cure Amount is included in the calculation of Consolidated Adjusted
EBITDA as a result of any exercise of the Cure Right, such Cure Amount shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether any financial ratio-based condition to the availability of, or “grower basket” in, any
carve-out
set forth in
Article 6
of this Agreement has been satisfied during each Fiscal Quarter in which the pro forma adjustment applies (and, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the amount of any
Cure Amount be included in Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA).

granted by the Borrower to secure any of the Secured Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as “collateral agent” and any
co-agents,

sub-agents
and
attorneys-in-fact
appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to

Section

8.06
for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof granted under the Loan Documents, or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent),
shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Article 8 and Article 9, as though such
co-agents,

sub-agents
and
attorneys-in-fact
were the “collateral agent” under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto. The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to the
Administrative Agent, including, without limitation, its right to be indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable: (i) by the Administrative Agent in each Loan Document and any other document related hereto or thereto to which it is a
party and (ii) the entity serving as the Administrative Agent in each of its capacities hereunder and in each of its capacities under any Loan Document whether or not specifically set forth therein and each agent, custodian and other Person
employed to act hereunder and under any Loan Document or related document, as the case may be.

Section 8.02
Rights as a
Lender
. Any Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term
“Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, unless the context otherwise requires or unless such Person is in fact not a Lender, include each Person serving as Administrative Agent hereunder in its
individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower or any of
its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to provide such information to them.


Section 8.03
Exculpatory Provisions
. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly
set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:

(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default exists, and the use of
the term “agent” herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable
Requirements of Law; it being understood that such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties;



159



(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary
power or permissive rights, except discretionary rights and powers that are expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents and which the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as is expressly required pursuant to this Agreement);
provided
, that the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take such actions if it is not indemnified to its satisfaction by
such Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action and in no event shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the
opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Requirements of Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under
any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law. For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting any rights, protections, immunities or
indemnities afforded to the Administrative Agent hereunder (including without limitation this
Article 8
) or under any other Loan Document, phrases such as “satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,” “approved by the
Administrative Agent,” “acceptable to the Administrative Agent,” “as determined by the Administrative Agent,” “in the Administrative Agent’s discretion,” “selected by the Administrative Agent,”
“elected by the Administrative Agent,” “requested by the Administrative Agent”, and phrases of similar import that authorize or permit the Administrative Agent to approve, disapprove, determine, act or decline to act in its
discretion shall be subject to the Administrative Agent receiving written direction from the Required Lenders (or, solely to the extent expressly required pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, the Required Lenders or such other
number or percentage of Lenders expressly specified therein) to take such action or exercise such rights;

(c) notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Administrative Agent be responsible for determining whether BXCI (or its Affiliates or Approved Funds) (or any other number, group or percentage of the Lenders (including a group constituting
the Required Lenders)) are acting reasonably in connection with any direction to the Administrative Agent or any determination, consent or request under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability
to the Borrower or any Lender in the event that it is subsequently determined that any Lender or group of Lender did not act reasonably in connection with any direction to the Administrative Agent or determination, consent or request under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents;

(d) shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds in the performance of any of its duties
or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder;

(e) shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of the
terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument, or document other than this Agreement and any other Loan Document, whether or not an original or a copy of such agreement has been provided to the Administrative Agent;



160



(f) except for notices, reports and other documents received by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to the Loan Documents and requested by any Lender, shall not have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, to any Lender, any credit or other information concerning the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition of creditworthiness of the Borrower or its Affiliates that is communicated to, obtained or in the possession of, the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties in any capacity,
except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein;

(g)
shall not be liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request or direction of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as is expressly required
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document), in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein or in any other Loan Document;

(h) shall not be liable in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by the final
non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein;

(i) shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement arising out of or
caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its control, including without limitation, any act or provision of any present or future law or regulation or governmental authority; acts of God; earthquakes; fires; floods; wars; terrorism;
civil or military disturbances; sabotage; epidemics; riots; interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications service; accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority or governmental
actions; or the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or telex or other wire or communication facility; and

(j) shall not be
deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or the occurrence of any other event or fact unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or any Lender, and, notwithstanding anything herein
or in any Loan Document to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document,
(ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection with any Loan Document, (iii) the performance or observance of (or monitor the performance or any action of the Borrower, the Lenders or
any other Person of, or in connection with) any covenant, agreement or other term or condition set forth in any Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness
of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, (v) the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien on the Collateral or the existence, value or sufficiency of the Collateral or to assure that the Liens granted to the
Administrative Agent pursuant to any Loan Document have been or will continue to be properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth
in
Article 4
or elsewhere in any Loan Document, (vii) any property, book or record of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof or (viii) compliance by Affiliated Lenders and Defaulting Lenders with the terms hereof relating to
Affiliated Lenders and Defaulting Lenders.

Section 8.04
Exclusive Right to Enforce Rights and Remedies
. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein or in any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Secured Party agree that:



161



(a) No Secured Party (other than the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions
of the Loan Documents) shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral; it being understood (i) that any right to realize upon the Collateral pursuant hereto or pursuant to any other Loan Document may be exercised solely
by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof, and (ii) in the event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent on any of the
Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or in the event of any other Disposition (including pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code), (A) the Administrative Agent, as agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (either
directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), upon directions from the Required Lenders, shall be entitled (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders), for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price
for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such sale or other Disposition, to use and apply all or any portion of the Obligations (other than Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent) as a credit on account of the purchase price for
any Collateral payable by the Administrative Agent at such sale or other Disposition and (B) any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of all or any portion of such Collateral at any such Disposition;

(b) [reserved]; and

(c) Each
Secured Party agrees that the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) may (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles), but is under no obligation to, credit bid all or any part of the Secured
Obligations (other than the Secured Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent) or to purchase or retain or acquire any portion of the Collateral;
provided
, that, in connection with any such credit bid or purchase, the Secured Obligations
(other than the Secured Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent) owed to all of the Secured Parties (other than with respect to contingent or unliquidated liabilities) may be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent on a ratable
basis.

Each Secured Party whose Secured Obligations are credit bid under the immediately preceding paragraph is entitled to receive
interests in the Collateral or any other asset acquired in connection with such credit bid (or in the Capital Stock of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such acquisition) on a ratable basis in accordance with the
percentage obtained by dividing (x) the amount of the Secured Obligations of such Secured Party that were credit bid in such credit bid or other Disposition, by (y) the aggregate amount of all Secured Obligations that were credit bid in
such credit bid or other Disposition.

Section 8.05
Reliance by Administrative Agent
.

(a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) that it believes to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise
authenticated by the proper Person, not only as to due execution, validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or
by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the
satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent has received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any
such



162



counsel, accountants or experts. In the event that any Collateral shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order
of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the Collateral, the Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to respond as it deems appropriate or to comply with
all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, or which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall
have no obligation or responsibility to determine compliance with and shall have no liability with respect to any amendment effected pursuant to,
Sections 2.22
,
2.23
or
5.13
of this Agreement.

(a) Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors shall deliver a notice (which may be made via email by it or its counsel) on the Restatement Date
(upon which the Administrative Agent may conclusively rely) confirming that it is a Lender and setting forth the name of each of its Affiliates, as well as funds or accounts managed, advised or
sub-advised
by
it, that are Lenders, for purpose of determining the Lenders constituting “BXCI”; provided, however, that from time to time, Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors may, by delivering to the Administrative Agent an updated notice (which may
be made via email by Blackstone Alternative Credit Advisors or its counsel), change the information previously provided by it pursuant to this Section 8.05(b), but the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the then
current notice until receipt of a superseding notice.

(b) Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that, each Lender that is a Required Lender
shall have no obligation or duty to any other Lender, or to consider or take into account the interest of any other Lender, in exercising any of its or their rights, rights to direct, request, determine and consent or any other rights as a Required
Lender under this Agreement and any other Loan Document and neither the Administrative Agent nor any of the Required Lenders shall be liable to any other Lender for any action taken by it or them or at the direction, request, consent or
determination of the Required Lenders or any failure by it or them to act or to direct, request, consent or determine that an action be taken, without regard to whether such action or inaction benefits or adversely affects any other Lender, the
Borrower, or any other Person.

Section 8.06
Delegation of Duties
. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more
sub-agents
appointed by it. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent
may perform any and
all of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this
Article 8
shall apply to any such
sub-agent

and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent
and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as
well as activities as the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the acts or omissions of any
sub-agents
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.

Section 8.07
Successor Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving ten days’ written
notice to the Lenders and the Borrower;
provided
, that if no successor agent is appointed in accordance with the terms set forth below within such
10-day
period, the Administrative Agent’s
resignation shall not be effective until the earlier to occur of (x) the date of the appointment of the successor agent or (y) the date that is 20 days after the last day of such
10-day
period (or
such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (“
Resignation Effective Date
”). At the election of (x) the Required Lenders, at any time, (y) the Borrower, if the Administrative Agent is a



163



Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender, or (z) the Borrower, with the prior consent of the Required Lenders, if the Administrative Agent is no longer able to administer the
Credit Facility, the Required Lenders or the Borrower, as applicable, may, upon ten days’ notice, remove the Administrative Agent;
provided
, that if no successor agent is appointed in accordance with the terms set forth below within such

10-day
period, the Administrative Agent’s removal shall, at the option of the Borrower, not be effective until the earlier to occur of (x) the date of the appointment of the successor agent or
(y) the date that is 20 days after the last day of such
10-day
period (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (“
Removal Effective Date
”). Upon receipt of any such
notice of resignation or delivery of any such notice of removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a
commercial bank or trust company with offices in the U.S. having, in the case of a commercial bank, combined capital and surplus in excess of $1,000,000,000;
provided
, that during the existence and continuation of an Event of Default under

Section
7.01(a)
or, with respect to the Borrower,
Sections 7.01(f)
or
(g)
, no consent of the Borrower shall be required. If no successor has been appointed as provided above and accepted such appointment
within ten days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation or the Administrative Agent receives notice of removal, then (a) in the case of a retirement, the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the consent of the Borrower) or (b) in the case of a removal, the Borrower may,
after consulting with the Required Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above;
provided
, that (x) in the case of a retirement, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the
Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment or (y) in the case of a removal, the Borrower notifies the Required Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then, in each case, such resignation or removal
shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with the provisos to the first two sentences in this paragraph on the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as the case may be. With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or
the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security
held by the Administrative Agent in its capacity as collateral agent for the Secured Parties for purposes of maintaining the perfection of the Lien on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue
to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) all payments, communications and determinations required to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by
or to each Lender directly (and each Lender will cooperate with the Borrower to enable the Borrower to take such actions), until such time as the Required Lenders or the Borrower, as applicable, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, as provided
above in this
Article 8
. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder as a successor Administrative Agent, the successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent and other rights that expressly survive the Administrative Agent’s resignation or
replacement), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder (other than its obligations under
Section
9.13
hereof). The fees payable by the Borrower to any
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor Administrative Agent. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and
Section
9.03
shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents
and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the relevant Person was acting as Administrative Agent (including for this purpose holding any collateral security following the retirement



164



or removal of the Administrative Agent). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Disqualified Institution (nor any Affiliate thereof) may be appointed as a successor Administrative
Agent. Any corporation or association into which the Administrative Agent may be converted or merged, or with which it may be consolidated, or to which it may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business and assets as a
whole or substantially as a whole, or any corporation or association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer to which the Administrative Agent is a party, will be and become the successor Administrative Agent
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and will have and succeed to the rights, powers, duties, immunities and privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any instrument or paper or the performance of any further
act;
provided
, that the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders and the Borrower of any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or transfer and cooperate with any filing or other step reasonably requested by the Required
Lenders to maintain or preserve their liens on the Collateral.

Section 8.08
Non-Reliance

on Administrative Agent and the other Lenders
. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that the Administrative Agent has made no representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereafter taken including any consent to,
and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender as to any matter, including whether the
Administrative Agent have disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties’) possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend
credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their respective Related Parties and based on such documents and information
as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower.

Section 8.09
Collateral and Guaranty Matters
. Each Secured Party irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to,
and the Administrative Agent shall:

(a) release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan
Document (i) upon the occurrence of the Termination Date, (ii) that is sold or to be sold or transferred as part of or in connection with any Disposition permitted under the Loan Documents, (iii) that does not constitute (or ceases to
constitute) Collateral or (iv) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders (or all Lenders if required by
Section
9.02
) in accordance with
Section
9.02
;

(b) [reserved];



165



(c) subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent
under any Loan Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by

,
6.02(l)
,
6.02(m)
,
6.02(n)
,
6.02(o)
,
6.02(r)
,
6.02(u)

(to the extent the relevant Lien is of the type to which the Lien of the Administrative Agent is otherwise required to be subordinated under this
clause (c)

Section
6.02
that are expressly included in this
clause (c)
),
6.02(x)
,
6.02(y)
,
6.02(z)(i)
,
6.02(bb)
,
6.02(cc)
,

(in the case of
6.02(dd)(ii)
, to the extent
the relevant Lien covers Cash or Cash Equivalents posted to secure the relevant obligation),
6.02(ee)
,
6.02(ff)
and/or
6.02(gg)
(and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any thereof to the extent such Refinancing
Indebtedness is permitted to be secured under
Section
6.02(k)
);
provided
, that the subordination of any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent shall only be required with respect to any
Lien on such property that is permitted by the above referenced sections to the extent that the Lien of the Administrative Agent with respect to such property is required to be subordinated to the relevant Permitted Lien in accordance with the
documentation governing the Indebtedness that is secured by such Permitted Lien; and

(d) enter into subordination, intercreditor,
collateral trust and/or similar agreements with respect to Indebtedness (including any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and/or any amendment to any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement) that is (i) required or permitted to be subordinated
hereunder and/or (ii) secured by Liens permitted hereunder, and with respect to which Indebtedness, this Agreement contemplates an intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement.

Upon the request of the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required Lenders (or all Lenders, if required by

Section
9.02
) will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent’s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or to release the Borrower from its Lien on any Collateral
pursuant to this
Article 8
. In each case as specified in this
Article 8
, the Administrative Agent will (and each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower’s expense, execute and deliver to the Borrower
such documents as the Borrower may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents, to subordinate its interest therein in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents and this
Article 8
;
provided
, that upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall deliver a certificate of a Responsible Officer (and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent
to conclusively rely on such certificate) certifying that the relevant transaction has been consummated in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Loan Documents and the execution by the Administrative Agent of any release or
subordination documents related thereto is authorized or permitted by the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Loan Documents.

The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the
Administrative Agent’s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by the Borrower in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the
Collateral.

Section 8.10
Intercreditor Agreements
. The Administrative Agent is authorized by the Lenders and each other
Secured Party to enter into any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement contemplated hereby with respect to any Indebtedness (i) that is (A) required or permitted
hereunder to be subordinated in right of payment or with respect to security and/or (B) secured by any Lien and (ii) which contemplates an intercreditor, subordination, collateral trust or similar agreement (any such other intercreditor,
subordination, collateral trust and/or similar agreement, an “
Additional Agreement
”), and the Secured Parties party hereto acknowledge that any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and any other Additional Agreement is binding upon
them so long as any such Additional Agreement (other than any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement



166



of the kind described in
clauses (a)
or
(b)
of the definition thereof) is approved by the Required Lenders. Each Lender and each other Secured Party party hereto hereby
(a) agrees that they will be bound by, and will not take any action contrary to, the provisions of any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement or any other Additional Agreement and (b) authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to enter
into any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and/or any other Additional Agreement and to subject the Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations to the provisions thereof so long as any such Additional Agreement (other than any
Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement of the kind described in
clauses (a)
or
(b)
of the definition thereof) is approved by the Required Lenders. The foregoing provisions are intended as an inducement to the Secured Parties to extend
credit to the Borrower, and the Secured Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of such provisions and the provisions of any Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and/or any other Additional Agreement.

Section 8.11
Indemnification of Administrative Agent
. To the extent that (i) the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate
thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower in accordance with and to the extent required by
Section
9.03
hereof or (ii) in connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, pursuant to
Section
9.03(a)(i)
, the Borrower is not required to reimburse the Administrative Agent, then in each case, the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify
the Administrative Agent (and any Affiliate or Related Party thereof) in proportion to their respective Applicable Percentages (determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the Administrative Agent (or any Affiliate or Related Party thereof) in performing its
duties hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;
provided
, that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent’s (or such affiliate’s) gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and
non-appealable
decision).

Section 8.12
Withholding Taxes
.
To the extent required by any applicable Requirement of Law (as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any
applicable withholding Tax. Without limiting or expanding the provisions of
Section
2.17
, each Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent against, and shall make payable in respect thereof within ten
days after demand therefor, any and all Taxes and any and all related losses, claims, liabilities and expenses (including fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent) incurred by or asserted against the Administrative
Agent by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority as a result of the failure of the Administrative Agent to properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of such Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was
not delivered or not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of withholding Tax ineffective). A certificate as to the amount of
such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this paragraph. The agreements in this paragraph shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of
rights by, or the replacement of, any Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, that none of the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates is a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement (including

shall be under no obligation (i) to monitor, determine or verify the unavailability or cessation of Term SOFR (or other applicable benchmark interest rate), or whether or when there has occurred, or to give notice to any other transaction party
of the occurrence of, any date on which such rate may be required to be transitioned or replaced in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, applicable Requirements of Law or otherwise, (ii) to select, determine or designate any
replacement to such rate, or other successor or replacement benchmark index, or whether any conditions to the designation of such a rate have been satisfied, (iii) to select, determine or designate any modifier to any replacement or successor
index, or (iv) to determine whether or what any amendments to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents are necessary or advisable, if any, in connection with any of the foregoing. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any
inability, failure or delay on its part to perform any of its duties set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document as a result of the unavailability of Term SOFR (or other applicable benchmark interest rate), in each case, as a result of
any inability, delay, error or inaccuracy on the part of any other party, including without limitation the Required Lenders or the Borrower, in providing any direction, instruction, notice or information required or contemplated by the terms of this

Section 9.02
Waivers; Amendments
.

(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall operate as a waiver thereof except as provided herein or in any Loan Document, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under any other Loan Document are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any party hereto therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same is permitted by this

Section
9.02
, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which it is given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Law, the making of any Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of
Default at the time.

(b) Subject to this
Section
9.02(b)
and
Sections 9.02(c)
and
(d)
below
and to
Section
9.05(f)

agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) or (ii) in the case of any other Loan Document (other than any waiver, amendment or modification
to effectuate any modification thereto expressly contemplated by the terms of such other Loan Document), pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, with the consent of the Required
Lenders;
provided
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing:

(A) the consent of each Lender directly and adversely
affected thereby (but not the consent of the Required Lenders) shall be required for any waiver, amendment or modification that:



172



(1) increases the Commitment of such Lender (other than with respect to any
Incremental Facility pursuant to
Section
2.22
or any Extended Term Loans pursuant to
Section
2.23
in respect of which such Lender has agreed to be an Additional Lender); it being understood that no
amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of the Commitments shall constitute an increase
of any Commitment of such Lender;

(2) reduces the principal amount of any Loan owed to such Lender or any amount due to
such Lender on any Loan Installment Date;

(3) (x) extends the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or (y) postpones any
Loan Installment Date or any Interest Payment Date with respect to any Loan held by such Lender or the date of any scheduled payment of any fee or premium payable to such Lender hereunder (in each case, other than any extension for administrative
reasons agreed by the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders));

(4) reduces the rate of
interest (other than to waive any Default or Event of Default or obligation of the Borrower to pay interest to such Lender at the default rate of interest under
Section
2.13(d)
, which shall only require the consent of the
Required Lenders) or the amount of any fee or premium owed to such Lender; it being understood that no change in any ratio used in the calculation of the Applicable Rate, if any, or in the calculation of any other interest, fee or premium due
hereunder (including any component definition thereof) shall constitute a reduction in any rate of interest or fee hereunder;

(5) extends the expiry date of such Lender’s Commitment; it being understood that no amendment, modification or waiver
of, or consent to departure from, any condition precedent, representation, warranty, covenant, Default, Event of Default, mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of any Commitment shall constitute an extension of any Commitment of any Lender;
and

(6) waives, amends or modifies the provisions of
Sections 2.18(b)
or
(c)
of this Agreement or the
definition of “Applicable Percentage”, in each case, in a manner that would by its terms alter the sharing of payments or application of proceeds required thereby and, for the avoidance of doubt, any other provision of this Agreement
relating to the pro rata sharing of payments in respect of the Credit Facility or the order in which payments are applied to repay the Obligations (in each case, except in connection with any transaction permitted under
Sections 2.22
,

2.23
,
9.02(c)
and/or
9.05(g)
or as otherwise provided in this
Section
9.02
);

(B) no agreement shall:



173

Section
9.02

determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender; or

or substantially all of the value of the Collateral from the Lien granted pursuant to the Collateral Documents (except as otherwise permitted herein or in the other Loan Documents, including pursuant to
Article 8
or

Section
9.22
hereof), without the prior written consent of each Lender or (B) (I) contractually subordinate the Lien on the Collateral securing the Secured Obligations to any other Indebtedness for borrowed money
(other than in connection with (x) any Acceptable
Debtor-In-Possession
Financing or the use of Collateral in any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
(y) any financing with respect to which each Lender is offered a reasonable opportunity to provide such financing on a ratable basis) or (II) expressly contractually subordinate the Loans in right of payment to any other Indebtedness for
borrowed money or Indebtedness of the kind described in
clause (c)
of the definition thereof, in each case, without the prior written consent of each Lender; and

(C) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended:

refinancing or replacement of all or any portion of the outstanding Term Loans under the applicable Class (any such loans being refinanced or replaced, the “

Section
6.01(a)
) and, to the extent any such additional amount is secured, the related Lien is permitted under
Section
6.02
(other than

pari passu
with
or junior to any then-existing Class of Term Loans in right of payment and may be
pari passu
with or junior to such Class of Term Loans with respect to the Collateral or unsecured;
provided
, that any such Class of
Replacement Term Loans that is pari passu with or junior to any then-existing Class of Term Loan shall be subject to an Acceptable Intercreditor Agreement and may be, at the option of the Required Lenders and the Borrower, documented in a
separate agreement or agreements,

(D) any Class of Replacement Term Loans that is secured may not be secured by any
asset other than the Collateral,

(E) no Class of Replacement Term Loans may be guaranteed by any Person,

determined by the Borrower) for the applicable type of Indebtedness or (3) reasonably acceptable to the Required Lenders (it being agreed that terms and conditions of any Replacement Term Loans that are more favorable to the lenders or the
agent of such Replacement Term Loans than those contained in the Loan Documents and are then conformed (or added) to the Loan Documents pursuant to the applicable Refinancing Amendment shall be deemed satisfactory to the Required Lenders), and

(ii) [reserved];

provided
,
further

sub-clauses

of this
clause (c)
, any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate and Debt Fund Affiliate shall be permitted without the consent of the Administrative Agent to provide any Class of Replacement Term Loans, it being understood that in connection

Each party hereto hereby agrees that this Agreement may be amended by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) and the lenders providing the relevant Class of Replacement Term Loans to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of such
Class of Replacement Term Loans incurred or implemented pursuant thereto (including any amendment necessary to treat the loans and commitments subject thereto as a separate “tranche” and “Class” of Loans and/or commitments
hereunder). It is understood that any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of any Class of Replacement Term Loans may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide such Class of Replacement Term Loans.

(iii) if the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower have jointly identified any ambiguity,
mistake, defect, inconsistency, obvious error or any error or omission of a technical nature or any necessary or desirable technical change, in each case, in any provision of any Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent (acting at the direction
of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision solely to address such matter as reasonably determined by them acting jointly,

any Defaulting Lender shall be excluded from any vote hereunder that requires the consent of any Lender, except as expressly provided in
Section
2.21(b)
),



176



(vii) this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of
the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit any extension of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and

affected Class in lieu of the consent of the Required Lenders (or 100% in lieu of all Lenders, in each case, to the extent such amendment, waiver or modification would otherwise require such a greater percentage); and

Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “

any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and/or
the enforcement of the Loan Documents, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans, (iii) any actual or alleged Release or presence of Hazardous Materials on, at, under or from any property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by

any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto (and regardless of whether such matter is initiated by a third party or by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates);

provided
, that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, or liability (A) is determined by a final and
non-appealable
judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence, or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or, other than with respect to the Administrative Agent or its Related Parties, to the extent such judgment finds that any such
loss, claim, damage, or liability has resulted from such Person’s bad faith or material breach of the Loan Documents or (B) arises out of any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding brought by such Indemnitee against another
Indemnitee (other than any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding that is brought by or against the Administrative Agent acting in its capacity as the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties) that does not involve any act or
omission of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Each Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund or return any and all amounts paid by the Borrower pursuant to this
Section
9.03(b)
to such Indemnitee for any fees,
expenses, or damages to the extent such Indemnitee is not entitled to payment thereof in accordance with the terms hereof. All amounts due under this
Section
9.03(b)
shall be payable by the Borrower within 30 days (x) after
receipt by the Borrower of a written demand therefor, in the case of any indemnification obligations and (y) in the case of reimbursement of costs and expenses, after receipt by the Borrower of an invoice setting forth such costs and expenses
in reasonable detail, together with backup documentation supporting the relevant reimbursement request. This
Section
9.03(b)
shall not apply to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages or
liabilities in respect of a
non-Tax
claim.

the written consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) or (other than with respect to the reimbursement and indemnification rights of the Administrative Agent and its Related Parties) any other
loss, claim, damage, liability and/or expense incurred in connection therewith, but if any proceeding is settled with the written consent of the Borrower, or if there is a final and
non-appealable
judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction against any Indemnitee in any such proceeding, the Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee to the extent and in the manner set forth above. The Borrower shall not, without the prior written
consent of the affected Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
Indemnitee, unless (i) such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnitee from all liability or claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) such settlement does not include any statement as to any
admission of fault or culpability (it being understood that any Indemnitee may reasonably withhold its consent to any settlement that does not comply with this sentence in any material respect).

Secured Party shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any other party hereto, the Borrower and/or any Related Party of any thereof, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to

any Indemnitee against the Borrower, to the extent such damages would otherwise be subject to indemnification pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of

180



(iii) Subject to the acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph

(b)(v)
of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in any Assignment Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned pursuant to such Assignment Agreement, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of

,
2.17
and
9.03
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring on or prior to the effective date of such assignment and (B) subject to its obligations thereunder and under

non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the U.S. a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, and the commitment of, and principal amount of and stated interest on the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“
Register
”). Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Borrower’s obligations in respect of such Loans. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error,
and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and each Lender (but only as to its own holdings), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(vi) By executing and delivering an Assignment Agreement, the assigning Lender and the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be deemed to confirm
and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (A) the assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim and that the amount of its
commitments, and the outstanding balances of its Loans, in each case, without giving effect to any assignment thereof which has not become effective, are as set forth in such Assignment Agreement, (B) except as set forth in

by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (C) the assignee represents and warrants



181

and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment
Agreement; (E) the assignee will independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it deems appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (F) the assignee appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent, by the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (G) the assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

(c) (i) Any Lender may, without the
consent of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, sell participations to any bank or other entity (other than to any Disqualified Institution or any natural person, the Borrower or, other than with respect to any participation
to any Debt Fund Affiliate (any such participations to a Debt Fund Affiliate being subject to the limitation set forth in the first proviso of the penultimate paragraph set forth in
Section
9.05(g)
, as if the limitation
applied to such participations), the Borrower or any of its Affiliates) (a “
Participant
”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its commitments and the
Loans owing to it);
provided
, that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and
(C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant
to which any Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
, that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the relevant Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in (x)
clause (A)
of the first proviso to

Section
9.02(b)
that directly and adversely affects the Loans or commitments in which such Participant has an interest and (y)
clauses (B)(1)
or
(2)
of the first proviso to

Section
9.02(b)
. Subject to
paragraph (c)(ii)
of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15
,
2.16
and
2.17
(subject to the
limitations and requirements of such Sections and
Section
2.19
) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (b)
of this Section and it being
understood that the documentation required under
Section
2.17(f)
shall be delivered to the participating Lender, and if additional amounts are required to be paid pursuant to
Section
2.17(a)
or

Section
2.17(c)
, to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent). To the extent permitted by applicable Requirements of Law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section
9.09
as
though it were a Lender;
provided
, that such Participant shall be subject to
Section
2.18(c)
as though it were a Lender.

(i) No Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section
2.15
,
2.16
or
2.17

than the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent (in its
sole discretion), expressly acknowledging that such Participant’s entitlement to benefits under
Sections 2.15
,
2.16
and
2.17
is not limited to what the participating Lender would have been entitled to receive absent the
participation.



182



Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and their respective successors and registered assigns, and the principal and interest amounts of
each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (a “
Participant Register
”);
provided
, that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of any Participant
Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to any Participant’s interest in any Commitment, Loan or any other obligation under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is
necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the U.S. Treasury Regulations and

Section 1.163-5(b)
of the U.S. Proposed Treasury Regulations (or any amended or successor version). The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Lender shall
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

(d) (i) Any Lender may at any time
pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (other than to any Disqualified Institution or any natural person) to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to any Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this
Section
9.05
shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;

provided
, that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release any Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(i) If any Lender (other than any Lender that is a Regulated Bank), in its capacity as a Lender, enters into a total return swap, total rate
of return swap, credit default swap or other derivative instrument under which any Secured Obligation is a sole reference obligation (or a reference obligation constituting at least 5.00% of the weight in any bucket of such derivative instruments)
(any such swap or other derivative instrument, an “
Obligations Derivative Instrument
”) with any counterparty that is a Disqualified Institution, the Borrower shall be entitled to seek specific performance to unwind the applicable
Obligations Derivative Instrument at the sole cost and expense of the applicable Lender, but such unwind right shall not extend to Obligations Derivative Instruments that were entered into both (A) on the public side of an information wall and
(B) not by or on behalf of such Lender in its capacity as a Lender;
provided
,
further
, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Confidential Information be shared with any counterparty to an Obligations Derivatives
Instrument that is a Disqualified Institution and each Lender shall be required to comply with the provisions of
Section
9.13
in connection with any transactions involving Obligations Derivative Instruments.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a “
Granting Lender
”) may grant to a special purpose
funding vehicle (an “
SPC
”), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that such Granting
Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement;
provided
, that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such
option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of any Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender
to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise
increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under



183



this Agreement (including its obligations under
Section
2.15
,
2.16
or
2.17
) and no SPC shall be entitled to any greater amount under

Section
2.15
,
2.16
or
2.17
or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document that the Granting Lender would have been entitled to receive, unless the grant to such SPC is made with the prior
written consent of the Borrower (in its sole discretion), expressly acknowledging that such SPC’s entitlement to benefits under
Sections 2.15
,
2.16
and
2.17
is not limited to what the Granting Lender would have been
entitled to receive absent the grant to the SPC, (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting Lender) and (iii) the Granting Lender
shall for all purposes including approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification of any provision of the Loan Documents, remain the Lender of record hereunder. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any
other Person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the Requirements of Law of the U.S. or any State thereof;
provided
, that (i) such SPC’s Granting
Lender is in compliance in all material respects with its obligations to the Borrower hereunder and (ii) each Lender designating any SPC hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party hereto for any loss, cost, damage or
expense arising out of its inability to institute such a proceeding against such SPC during such period of forbearance. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section
9.05
, any SPC may
(i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loan to the Granting Lender and
(ii) disclose on a confidential basis any
non-public
information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guaranty or credit or liquidity enhancement
to such SPC.

(f) (i) Any assignment or participation by a Lender (A) to or with any Disqualified Institution or (B) without the
Borrower’s consent to the extent the Borrower’s consent is required under this
Section
9.05
(and not deemed to have been given pursuant to
Section
9.05(b)(i)(A)
), in each case, to any
Person, shall not be null and void, but the Borrower may require such Disqualified Institution (upon written notice to the Disqualified Institution) to promptly (and in any event within five Business Days of such written notice) assign, without
recourse and in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 9.05, all Loans and Commitments then owned by such Disqualified Institution to another Lender (other than Defaulting Lender) or Eligible Assignee (and the
Borrower shall be entitled to seek specific performance in any applicable court of law or equity to enforce this sentence and/or specifically enforce this
Section
9.05(f)
in addition to injunctive relief (without posting a
bond or presenting evidence of irreparable harm) or any other remedy available to the Borrower at law or in equity; it being understood and agreed that (A) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will suffer irreparable harm if any Lender breaches
any obligation under this
Section
9.05
as it relates to any assignment, participation or pledge of any Loan or Commitment to any Person to whom the Borrower’s consent is required but not obtained and (B)
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section
9.05(f)
, any subsequent assignment by any Disqualified Institution (or any other Person to which an assignment or participation was made without the required consent
of the Borrower) to an Eligible Assignee that complies with the requirements of
Section
9.05(b)
will be deemed to be a valid and enforceable assignment for purposes hereof. Nothing in this
Section
9.05(f)

shall be deemed to prejudice any right or remedy that the Borrower may otherwise have at law or equity. Upon the request of any Lender, the Administrative Agent shall make the list of Disqualified Institutions provided to it by the Borrower
available to such Lender, and such Lender may provide the list of Disqualified Institutions to any potential assignee or participant or counterparty to any Obligations Derivative Instrument on a confidential basis in accordance with

Section
9.13
solely for the purpose of permitting such Person to verify whether such Person (or any Affiliate thereof) constitutes a Disqualified Institution.



184



(i) If any assignment or participation under this
Section
9.05
is
made to any Disqualified Institution and/or any Affiliate of any Disqualified Institution (other than any Bona Fide Debt Fund) without the Borrower’s prior written consent (any such person, a “
Disqualified Person
”), then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Person and the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate any Commitment of such Disqualified Person and repay all obligations of the Borrower owing to such
Disqualified Person, (B) in the case of any outstanding Term Loans, held by such Disqualified Person, purchase such Term Loans by paying the lesser of (x) par and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Person paid to acquire such Term
Loans,
plus
accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and/or (C) require such Disqualified Person to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
this
Section
9.05
), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Eligible Assignees;
provided
, that (I) in the case of
clause (B)
, the applicable Disqualified Person
has received payment of an amount equal to the lesser of (1) par and (2) the amount that such Disqualified Person paid for the applicable Loans,
plus
accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
from the Borrower, (II) in the case of
clauses (A)
and
(B)
, the Borrower shall not be liable to the relevant Disqualified Person under
Section
2.16
if any SOFR Loan owing to such Disqualified Person
is repaid or purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (III) in the case of
clause (C)
, the relevant assignment shall otherwise comply with this
Section
9.05
(except that
(x) no registration and processing fee required under this
Section
9.05
shall be required with any assignment pursuant to this paragraph and (y) any Term Loan acquired by any Affiliated Lender pursuant to this
paragraph will not be included in calculating compliance with the Affiliated Lender Cap for a period of 90 days following such transfer;

time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations (in any currency) at any time owing by the Administrative Agent or such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the Secured
Obligations held by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be contingent or unmatured or
are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different than the branch or office holding such deposit or obligation on such Indebtedness. Any applicable Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such
set-off
or application;
provided
, that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice shall not affect the validity of any such

Lenders
”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrower, its stockholders and/or their affiliates. The Borrower agrees that nothing in the Loan
Documents or otherwise will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on the one hand, and the Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates, on the other. The Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are
arm’s-length
commercial transactions

advised, is currently advising or will advise the Borrower, its stockholders or its Affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to the Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and (y) each Lender, in
its capacity as such, is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or any other Person. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Borrower has consulted its own legal,
tax and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and has not relied on the Administrative Agent, any Lender or their respective Approved Funds or Affiliates for any advice with respect to such matters and that it is responsible for
making its own independent judgment with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent and
each Lender with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty arising solely by virtue of the Loan Documents.

Agent’s instructions.

Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder

Section 9.24
Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs
. To the extent that
the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “
QFC Credit Support
” and each such QFC a “
Supported QFC
”),
the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “
U.S. Special Resolution Regimes
”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and
any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the U.S. or any other state of the U.S.).

(a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “
Covered

Party
”) becomes subject to a
proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property
securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and
any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the U.S. or a state of the U.S.. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special
Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such
Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the U.S. or a state of the U.S. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.

(b) As used in this
Section
9.24
, the following terms have the following meanings:

“
BHC Act Affiliate
” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined under, and interpreted
in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.

“
Covered Entity
” means any of the following:
(i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §
47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).

“
Default Right
” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12
C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable.

“
QFC
” has the meaning assigned to the term
“qualified financial contract” in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).

Exhibit 10.8

Confidential

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (this “
Agreement
”), is entered into on September 10, 2021 (the “
Effective
Date
”), by and between SOLV, Inc., a Delaware corporation (including any successor thereto, the “
Company
”), ASP SRE Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “
Holdings
”) and George Hershman
(“
Executive
”).

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

WHEREAS
, ASP SRE Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Swinerton Builders, a California corporation, Swinerton
Incorporated, a California corporation, and Holdings, are parties to that certain Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated of even date herewith (the “
Purchase Agreement
”); and

WHEREAS
, Holdings and the Company, contingent on the consummation of the transaction covered by the Purchase Agreement (the
“
Closing
”), desires that Executive render services to the Company following the Closing, pursuant to the terms and conditions herein, and Executive desires to provide such services to the Company on the terms and conditions herein
provided.

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

AGREEMENT

Section 1.
Employment
.

The Company
shall employ Executive, and Executive hereby accepts employment with the Company, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement for the period beginning on the date of the Closing and ending as provided in
Section 4
(the
“
Employment Period
”). This Agreement is expressly conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and shall automatically terminate and be void ab initio in the event the Purchase Agreement
is terminated or the Closing does not occur for any reason.

Section 2.
Position and Duties
.

(a) During the Employment Period, Executive shall serve as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and shall have the
customary duties, responsibilities, functions and authority as are commensurate with such position, subject to the customary oversight and direction of the board of managers (the “
Board
”) of Holdings. During the Employment Period,
Executive shall render such administrative, financial and other executive and managerial services to the Company and its Subsidiaries which are consistent with Executive’s position as the Board may from time to time direct. During the
Employment Period, but only while Executive serves as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Executive shall be appointed to serve on the board of directors of the Company and the Board. The Executive shall be covered by the directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy maintained by the Company on a basis no less favorable than the directors and senior executive officers of the Company.



(b) During the Employment Period, Executive shall report solely and directly to the Board
and shall devote his reasonable best efforts and full business time and attention (except for permitted vacation periods and reasonable periods of illness or other incapacity) to the business and affairs of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries.
All executive officers of the Company shall report to Executive. Executive shall perform his duties, responsibilities and functions for the Company and any of its Subsidiaries hereunder to the best of his abilities in a diligent, trustworthy,
professional and efficient manner and shall comply with the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ policies and procedures in all material respects. During the Employment Period, Executive shall not serve as an officer or director of, or
otherwise be employed by or perform services for, any other person or entity without the prior written consent of the Board;
provided
that Executive (x) may continue to serve as a director of the Solar Energy Industries Association and
(y) may serve as an officer or director of, or otherwise participate in, solely educational, welfare, social, religious and civic organizations, and shall inform the Board of such participation. Executive may also serve on a for-profit board of
directors with the prior written approval of the Board.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, “
Subsidiaries
” or
“
Subsidiary
” shall mean any corporation or other entity of which the securities or other ownership interests having the voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or other governing body are, at the time of
determination, owned by the Company, directly or through one of more Subsidiaries.

Section 3.
Compensation and Benefits
.

(a) During the Employment Period, Executive’s base salary shall be $500,000 per annum or such higher rate as the Board may determine from
time to time (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with this sentence, the “
Base Salary
”), which salary shall be payable by the Company in regular installments in accordance with the Company’s general payroll practices
in effect from time to time. The Base Salary shall be pro-rated on an annualized basis for any partial year during the Employment Period. In addition, during the Employment Period, Executive shall be entitled to participate in all of the
Company’s employee benefit programs for which senior executive employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries are generally eligible, and Executive shall be entitled to not less than four weeks of paid vacation each calendar year in accordance
with the Company’s policies, which if not taken during any year may not be carried forward to any subsequent calendar year and no compensation shall be payable in lieu thereof except as provided herein. The amount of the Executive’s Base
Salary shall be reviewed annually by the Board for possible increase (but not decrease) and may, at the discretion of the Board, be adjusted (but never below the Base Salary then in effect). Any such increased amount shall constitute “Base
Salary” hereunder.

(b) During the Employment Period, the Company shall reimburse Executive for all reasonable business expenses
incurred by him in the course of performing his duties and responsibilities under this Agreement which are consistent with the Company’s policies in effect from time to time with respect to travel (including business air travel consistent with
past practice), entertainment and other business expenses, subject to the Company’s requirements with respect to reporting and documentation of such expenses.



2



(c) In addition to the Base Salary, during the Employment Period, Executive will be eligible
to receive an annual cash bonus target of 200% of Base Salary ($1,000,000 based on the initial Base Salary) in accordance with the Company’s annual salaried bonus plan (the “
Target Annual Bonus
”). The achievement of a
particular bonus amount shall be based on reasonable performance objectives established by the Board at the time the budget is approved for the applicable fiscal year after consultation with the Executive. Any such bonus will be payable at the same
time annual bonuses are paid to other senior executives of the Company generally during the calendar year that begins immediately following the calendar year for which the bonus was earned, as soon as reasonably practicable following the completion
of the Company’s audit for the calendar year for which the bonus was earned, or in accordance with the Company’s bonus plan as set by the Compensation Committee of the Board, and shall be payable, except as provided in Section 4(b),
4(c) or 4(d) (as applicable) in this Agreement, only if Executive is employed by the Company on the date of payment.

(d) The Company or
its Subsidiaries may withhold from any and all amounts payable under this Agreement or otherwise such federal, state and local taxes as may be required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulation.

Section 4.
Term
.

(a) The
Employment Period shall begin on the date of the Closing and terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) Executive’s resignation (which may occur at any time with or without Good Reason, as defined below), (ii) Executive’s death or
Disability, and (iii) the termination of Executive by the Company at any time for Cause (as defined below) or without Cause. Except as otherwise expressly and specifically provided herein, any termination of the Employment Period by Executive
or the Board shall be effective as specified in a written notice from each to the other.

(b) If the Employment Period is terminated by
the Company without Cause or upon Executive’s resignation with Good Reason, the Company shall promptly pay or provide to Executive his then current Base Salary, accrued employee benefits (pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans), expense
reimbursements (pursuant to the Company’s expense reimbursement policy) and any unused vacation payable pursuant to the Company’s standard vacation practice through the date of termination (collectively, the “
Accrued
Obligations
”), the annual bonus in respect of the fiscal year prior to the year of the termination if such bonus is earned but not yet paid (“
Prior Year Bonus
”), and, subject to this
S
ection 4(b)
and

Section 11
, the following payments and benefits:

(i) an amount equal to the sum of Executive’s
(A) annual Base Salary rate and (B) Target Annual Bonus, in each case not taking into account any reduction which would constitute Good Reason or which was made within six (6) months prior to Executive’s termination of
employment, paid in accordance with the Company’s regular payroll practices for a period of twelve (12) months (the “
Severance Period
”) following such termination (provided, that, Executive shall not be treated as an
employee while receiving such amounts);



3



(ii) if the termination date occurs on or after the first day of the third
quarter of the fiscal year when such termination date occurs, a prorated annual bonus for the portion of the fiscal year worked prior to termination of the Employment Period based on actual performance achieved as determined as of the end of such
year payable when bonuses are generally paid to other Company executives (the “
Pro Rata Bonus
”);

(iii)
subject to the Executive’s timely election of continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“
COBRA
”) continued participation in the Company’s group health plan (to the
extent permitted under applicable law and the terms of such plan) which covers the Employee (and the Employee’s eligible dependents) for (i) a period of twelve (12) months following the Executive’s termination of employment,
which shall be paid for by the Company and (ii) a subsequent period of six (6) months following such initial 12-month period which shall be paid for by Executive but which will be subsidized by the Company (such that the Executive’s
cost of such COBRA coverage for such six-month period will be the same as the Executive would have paid had the Executive remained an employee and an active participant in the group health plan);
provided
that the Employee is eligible and
remains eligible for COBRA coverage; and
provided
,
further
, that in the event that the Executive obtains other employment that offers comparable group health benefits, such continuation of coverage by the Company under this

Section 4(b)(ii)
shall immediately cease.

Executive shall be entitled to the foregoing severance payments if and only if
Executive has executed and delivered to the Company the general release substantially in form and substance as set forth in
Exhibit A
attached hereto (the “
General Release

hereof) and not to payments (or the portion of any payment) that
are exempt from Code Section 409A (due to, for example, application of the short term deferral rule or separation pay exceptions). To the extent payment of any amount under Section 4(b)(i) or Section 4(d)(ii) constitutes “nonqualified

Delay Period
”) shall
instead be paid in a lump sum immediately upon (and not before) the expiration of the Delay Period to the extent required under Code Section 409A.

compensation hereunder which would have accrued or become payable after the termination of the Employment Period shall cease upon such termination or expiration, other than those expressly required under applicable law (such as COBRA). Nothing
contained herein is intended to limit or otherwise restrict the availability of any COBRA benefits to Executive required to be provided pursuant to Section 601 of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and
Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code. Except as otherwise provided in

the Company or its Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, an act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or breach of fiduciary duty against the Company or its Subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, the offer, payment, solicitation or
acceptance of any unlawful bribe or kickback with respect to the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ business; or (ii) Executive has been convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of, or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to, any

Subsidiaries and such refusal continues for more than twenty (20) days after written notice is given to Executive; or (vi) Executive has materially breached any of the terms contained herein or in any other employment agreement,
non-competition agreement, confidentiality agreement or similar type of agreement to which Executive is a party and such breach, if curable as determined by the Board in good faith, has not been cured within a period of twenty (20) days after
written notice to Executive from the Company specifying such breach; or (vii) Executive has engaged in (x) the unlawful use (including being under the influence) or possession of illegal drugs on the Company’s or its
Subsidiaries’ premises or (y) habitual drunkenness; (viii) Executive has knowingly and willfully violated the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ written policies in a way that the Board determines is detrimental to the best
interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries and such violation, if curable as determined by the Board in good faith, has not been cured within a period of twenty (20) days after written notice to Executive specifying such violation. Any
voluntary termination of employment by Executive in anticipation of an involuntary termination of Executive’s employment for Cause shall be deemed to be a termination for “Cause.” No action shall constitute “Cause” hereunder
if undertaken by Executive in good faith at the express direction of the Board.

(i) “
Disability

or mental disability to the extent that Executive cannot perform his duties as an employee (in his then-current position) of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a period of 120 consecutive days or 180 days in any 365-day period. Executive shall
cooperate in all respects with the Company if a question arises as to whether he has become disabled (including, without limitation, submitting to reasonable examinations by one or more medical doctors and other health care specialists jointly
selected by the Company and Executive and authorizing such medical doctors and other health care specialists to discuss Executive’s condition with the Company at the Company’s sole expense). Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver or
limitation with respect to the rights afforded to Executive under applicable law, including, without limitation of the foregoing, the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Family Medical Leave Act. In no event shall Executive be deemed
“Disabled” if he is unable to qualify for benefits under the Company’s disability plan.

(j) “
Good Reason
”
shall mean if Executive resigns from employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the end of the Employment Period following one or more of the following reasons, if done without Executive’s prior express written consent:

any other material compensation agreement for Executive;
provided
in any such case that in order for Executive’s resignation with Good Reason to be effective pursuant to any event that Executive believes constitutes Good Reason
(x) written notice of Executive’s resignation for Good Reason must be delivered to the Company within forty-five (45) days after Executive first becoming aware of the occurrence of any such event, (y) the Company shall be given
thirty (30) days following receipt of such notice to cure any such event and (z) Executive must actually terminate his employment citing Good Reason within sixty (60) days following the expiration of such cure period if the Company

of the Company or such Subsidiary. Executive acknowledges that all Work Product shall be deemed to constitute “works made for hire” under the U.S. Copyright Act of 1976, as amended.

(b) The Executive covenants and agrees not, directly or
indirectly, make or publish any statement (orally or in writing) that libels, slanders, disparages or otherwise harms the goodwill or reputation (whether or not such disparagement legally constitutes libel or slander) of the Company or any of its
officers, managers, directors, partners, members, shareholders or representatives (as applicable). The Executive shall not violate this provision by truthful statements made (i) in connection with any litigation or arbitration between the
Executive and any of the above persons; (ii) as required by applicable law or a governmental or regulatory investigation and (ii) during performance reviews in the ordinary course that may contain disparaging or harmful statement

Section 8.
Enforcement
.

If, at the
time of enforcement of
Section 5
,
Section 6
or
Section 7
a court shall hold that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period,
scope or geographical area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area
permitted by law. Because Executive’s services are unique and because Executive has access to Confidential Information and Work Product, the parties hereto agree that the Company and its Subsidiaries would suffer irreparable harm from a breach
of
Section 5
,
Section 6
or
Section 7
by Executive and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for any such breach of this Agreement. In the event a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the
Company and its Subsidiaries in addition to other rights and remedies existing in their favor, shall be entitled to specific performance and/or injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in order to enforce, or
prevent any violations of, the provisions hereof (without posting a bond or other security). In addition, in the event of a breach or violation by Executive of
Section 7
, the Restriction Period shall be extended automatically by the
amount of time between the initial occurrence of the breach or violation and when such breach or violation has been duly cured. Executive acknowledges that the restrictions contained in
Section 7
are reasonable and that he has reviewed
the provisions of this Agreement with his legal counsel.

Section 9.
Additional Acknowledgments
.

Executive acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 5
,
Section 6
or
Section 7
are in consideration of
employment with the Company and other good and valuable consideration as set forth in this Agreement. Executive also acknowledges that (i) the restrictions contained in
Section 5
,
Section 6
or
Section 7
do
not preclude Executive from earning a livelihood, nor do they unreasonably impose limitations on Executive’s ability to earn a living, (ii) the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be international in scope and without
geographical limitation and (iii) notwithstanding the jurisdiction of formation or principal office of the Company or residence of any of its executives or employees (including Executive), it is expected that the Company and its Subsidiaries
will have business activities and have valuable business relationships within its industry throughout the world. Executive agrees and acknowledges that the potential harm to the Company and its Subsidiaries resulting from the non-enforcement of

Section 5
,
Section 6
or
Section 7
outweighs any potential harm to Executive of the enforcement of such provisions by injunction or otherwise. Executive acknowledges that he has carefully read this Agreement and
has given careful consideration to the restraints



10



imposed upon Executive by this Agreement and is in full agreement regarding their necessity for the
reasonable and proper protection of the business goodwill, competitive positions and confidential and proprietary information of the Company and its Subsidiaries now existing or to be developed in the future and that each and every restraint imposed
by this Agreement is reasonable with respect to subject matter, time period and geographical area.

Section 10.

Representations

with independent legal counsel regarding his rights and obligations under this Agreement and that he fully understands the terms and conditions contained herein, and (y) Executive is not subject to any pending, or to his knowledge any
threatened, lawsuit, action, investigation or proceeding involving Executive’s prior employment or consulting work or the use of any information or techniques of any former employer or contracting party.

Internal Revenue Code Section 409A and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, “
Code Section 409A
”), and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be in
compliance with or exempt from Code Section 409A. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on Executive by Code Section 409A or for any damages for failing to comply with
Code Section 409A. In the event that the Company and Executive determine that any payment or benefit hereunder is not in compliance with Code Section 409A, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify the arrangement as necessary to
be in compliance, preserving, to the maximum extent possible, the original economic intent of the parties hereunder.

(b) A termination of
the Employment Period shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of this Agreement providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a
“separation from service” within the meaning of Code §409A, and for purposes of any such provision of this Agreement, references to a “termination,” “termination of the Employment Period,” “termination of
employment” or similar terms shall mean “separation from service.”



11



(c) To the extent any reimbursements or in-kind benefits under this Agreement constitute
“non-qualified deferred compensation” for purposes of Code §409A, (i) all such expenses or other reimbursements under this Agreement shall be made on or prior to the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in
which such expenses were incurred by Executive, (ii) any right to reimbursement or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and (iii) no such reimbursement, expenses eligible for reimbursement or
in-kind benefits provided in any taxable year shall in any way affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other taxable year.

(d) For purposes of Code §409A, Executive’s right to receive any installment payment pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as
a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under this Agreement specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days (
e.g.
, “payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the
date of termination”), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the Company’s sole discretion. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this
Agreement that constitutes “non-qualified deferred compensation” for purposes of Code §409A be subject to offset, counterclaim or recoupment by any other amount unless otherwise permitted by Code §409A without adverse tax
consequences to Executive.

I, George Hershman, in consideration of and subject to the performance by SOLV, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries,
the “Company”), of its obligations under that certain Employment Agreement, dated as of September 10, 2021, by and between the Company, ASP SRE Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership (“Holdings”), and me (the
“Agreement”; capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Agreement), do hereby release and forever discharge as of the date hereof the Company, its subsidiaries and its and their
affiliates and all present, future and former directors, officers, agents, representatives, employees, independent contractors, owners, shareholders, members, insurers and benefit plans, assigns, attorneys, predecessors, successors and assigns of
the Company, its subsidiaries and its affiliates and the Company’s direct or indirect owners (including Holdings), each in their respective official capacities as such (collectively, the “Released Parties”), to the extent provided
below.

1. I understand that any payments or benefits paid or granted to me under Section 4(b) or Section 4(d), as applicable, of the
Agreement represent, in part, consideration for signing this General Release and are not salary, wages or benefits to which I was already entitled. I understand and agree that I shall not receive the payments and benefits specified in
Section 4(b) or Section 4(d), as applicable, of the Agreement unless I execute this General Release and do not revoke this General Release within the time period permitted hereafter or breach this General Release. Such payments and
benefits shall not be considered compensation for purposes of any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained or hereafter established by the Company or its affiliates. I also acknowledge and represent that I have received all
payments and benefits that I am entitled to receive (as of the date hereof) by virtue of any employment by the Company and any of the Released Parties.

2. Except as provided in paragraph 4 below, I knowingly and voluntarily (for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, successors and
assigns) release and forever discharge the Company and the other Released Parties from any and all claims, suits, controversies, actions, causes of action, cross-claims, counter-claims, demands, debts, compensatory damages, liquidated damages,
punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for costs and attorneys’ fees, or losses, promises or liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law and in equity, both past and present and whether known or unknown, suspected, or claimed
against the Company or any of the Released Parties (hereinafter, “
Claims
”) which I, or any of my heirs, executors, administrators, successors or assigns, may have, through the date upon which I sign this General Release, including
those Claims which (a) arise out of or are connected with my employment with, or my separation or termination from, the Company or any of the Released Parties; (b) arise out of, or relate to, any agreement and/or any awards, policies,
plans, programs or practices of the Released Parties that may apply to me or in which I may participate and/or any rights under bonus, severance, or other plans or programs of Released Parties and/or any



1



other short-term or long-term cash-based incentive plans or programs of the Released Parties; or (c) arise out of, or relate to, my status as an employee, member, officer or director of any
of the Released Parties, including, but not limited to, any allegation, Claim or violation, arising under: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; the Civil Rights Act of 1991; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as
amended (including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act); the Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993; the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act; the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974; any applicable Executive Order Programs; the Fair Labor Standards Act; or their state or local counterparts; or under any other federal, state or local civil or human rights law, or under any other
local, state, or federal law, regulation or ordinance; or under any public policy, contract or tort, or under common law; or arising under any policies, practices or procedures of the Company or any of the Released Parties; or any Claim for wrongful
discharge, breach of contract, infliction of emotional distress, defamation; or any Claim for costs, fees, or other expenses, including attorneys’ fees incurred in these matters.

3. I represent that I have made no assignment or transfer of any right, Claim, demand, cause of action, or other matter covered by paragraph 2
above. I represent that I am not aware of any Claim by me other than the Claims that are released by this General Release. I acknowledge that I may hereafter discover Claims or facts in addition to or different than those which I now know or believe
to exist with respect to the subject matter of the release set forth in paragraph 2 above and which, if known or suspected at the time of entering into this General Release, may have materially affected this General Release and my decision to enter
into it. I hereby waive any right or Claim that might exist prior to signing this General Release as a result of the knowledge of such different or additional Claims or facts.

4. I agree that this General Release does not waive or release any rights or Claims that I may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act of 1967 which arise after the date I execute this General Release. I acknowledge and agree that my separation from employment with the Company shall not serve as the basis for any Claim or action (including, without limitation, any claim under
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967). Furthermore, this General Release does not release any Claim that relates to (a) my right to enforce this General Release; (b) any rights I may have to indemnification from personal
liability or to protection under any insurance policy maintained by the Company and its affiliates, including without limitation any general liability or directors and officers insurance policy and under any other document or agreement, including,

stakeholder in Holdings, the Company and any affiliate thereof; or (g) any Claim that by law cannot be waived.

5. I represent and agree that I have not, by myself or on my behalf, instituted, prosecuted,
filed, or processed any litigation, Claims or proceedings against the Company or any Released Parties, nor have I encouraged or assisted anyone to institute, prosecute, file, or process any litigation, Claims or proceedings against the Company or
any Released Parties. Notwithstanding the above, I further acknowledge that nothing in this General Release is intended to prohibit or restrict my right to file a charge with or participate in a charge by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
or any other local, state, or federal administrative body or government agency;
provided
that I hereby waive the right to recover any monetary damages or other relief against any Released Parties; and
provided
,
further
, that
nothing in this General Release shall prohibit me from receiving any monetary award to which I become entitled pursuant to Section 922 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

6. In signing this General Release, I acknowledge and intend that it shall be effective as a bar to each and every one of the Claims
hereinabove mentioned or implied. I expressly consent that this General Release shall be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to unknown and
unsuspected Claims (notwithstanding any state statute that expressly limits the effectiveness of a general release of unknown, unsuspected and unanticipated Claims), if any, as well as those relating to any other Claims hereinabove mentioned or
implied. I acknowledge and agree that this waiver is an essential and material term of this General Release and that without such waiver the Company would not have agreed to the terms of the Agreement. I further agree that in the event I should
bring a Claim seeking damages against the Company or any other Released Party, or in the event I should seek to recover against the Company or any other Released Party in any Claim brought by a governmental agency on my behalf, this General Release
shall serve as a complete defense to such Claims to the maximum extent permitted by law. I further agree that I am not aware of any pending Claim of the type described in paragraph 2 above as of the execution of this General Release.

7. I agree that neither this General Release, nor the furnishing of the consideration for this General Release, shall be deemed or construed
at any time to be an admission by the Company, any other Released Party or myself of any improper or unlawful conduct.

8. I agree that
this General Release and the Agreement are confidential and agree not to disclose any information regarding the terms of this General Release or the Agreement, except to my immediate family and any tax, legal, financial or other advisors or counsel
I have consulted regarding the meaning or effect hereof or as required by law, and I shall instruct each of the foregoing not to disclose the same to anyone. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties (and each affiliate
and person acting on behalf of any such party)



3



agrees that each party (and each employee, representative, and other agent of such party) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure
of the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and, all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party or such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure and I may also disclose to
prospective future employers or business partners any restrictive covenants I may be subject to. Except as set forth above, this authorization is not intended to permit disclosure of any other information including (without limitation) (a) any
portion of any materials to the extent not related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, (b) the identities of participants or potential participants in the Agreement, (c) any financial
information (except to the extent such information is related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement), or (d) any other term or detail not relevant to the tax treatment or the tax structure of
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

9. The non-disclosure provisions in this General Release do not prohibit or restrict me
(or my attorney) from (a) responding to any inquiry about this General Release or its underlying facts and circumstances by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., any other self-regulatory
organization or governmental entity; (b) making any disclosure of relevant and necessary information or documents in any action, investigation, or proceeding relating to this General Release or the Agreement, or as required by law or legal
process, including with respect to possible violations of law; (c) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding with, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any
self-regulatory organization, and/or pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; or (d) accepting any U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission awards. In addition, nothing in this General Release or any other agreement between the parties or any other
policies of the Company or its affiliates prohibits or restricts me from initiating communications with, or responding to any inquiry from, any regulatory or supervisory authority regarding any good faith concerns about possible violations of law or
regulation. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b), I will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret of the Company or its affiliates that (i) is made (x) in
confidence to a Federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to my attorney and (y) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or
other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. If I file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, I may disclose the trade secret to my attorney and use the trade secret
information in the court proceeding, if I file any document containing the trade secret under seal, and do not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this General Release or any other agreement between the parties or
any other policies of the Company or its affiliates is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by such section.



4



10. I agree that as of the date hereof, I have returned to the Company any and all property,
tangible or intangible, relating to the business of the Company and its affiliates, which I possessed or had control over at any time (including, but not limited to, company-provided credit cards, work-related passwords, building or office access
cards, keys, computer equipment, telephones, smartphones, laptops, manuals, files, documents, records, software, hard drives, recordings, tapes, reports, work product, customer data base and other data or non-public, confidential, proprietary and/or
trade secret information of the Company) and that I shall not retain any copies, compilations, extracts, excerpts, summaries or other notes of any such manuals, files, documents, records, software, customer data base or other data. If I discover any
property of the Company or non-public, confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information in my possession after my termination of employment, I shall promptly return such property to the Company or, at the instruction of the Company, destroy
such property or information. For the avoidance of doubt, I may retain copies of my contacts list, calendar and any files or records needed to retain my personal income tax returns.

11.
I hereby confirm all of my obligations under Section 7 of the Agreement and,
subject to paragraph 9 herein, hereby covenant
and agree not to, directly or indirectly, make, publish or communicate negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company, its direct or indirect owners or any of their respective subsidiaries, or its or their officers, directors, employees,
partners, members, stockholders, agents, or business, in any manner likely to be harmful to them or their business, business reputation or personal reputation except as permitted by Section 7 of the Agreement.

12. I shall not knowingly encourage, counsel or assist any non-governmental attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution of
any disputes, differences, grievances, Claims, charges or complaints by any non-governmental third party against any of the Released Parties, without requiring said parties to issue a subpoena, summons or warrant.

13. Notwithstanding anything in this General Release to the contrary, this General Release shall not relinquish, diminish, or in any way
affect any rights or Claims arising out of any breach by the Company or by any Released Party of the Agreement after the date hereof.

14.
Whenever possible, each provision of this General Release shall be interpreted in, such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this General Release is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this General Release shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

15. Sections 19, 20, 23 and 24 of
the Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

agree as follows:

AGREEMENTS

Section 1. Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement.


(a) During the period commencing on the date of Closing and ending on the later of (x) the date that is three years from the closing of
the Transaction and (y) the date that is two years from the date the Restricted Party is no longer employed by or providing services to Parent (the “

the period applicable to each obligation that the Restricted Party shall have been determined to have violated shall automatically be extended by a period of time equal in length to the period during which such violation(s) occurred.



(c) For a period of five (5) years following the date the Restricted Party is no longer
employed by or providing services to Parent, the Restricted Party agrees not to, directly or indirectly, make or publish any statement (orally or in writing) that libels, slanders, disparages or otherwise harms the goodwill or reputation (whether or
not such disparagement legally constitutes libel or slander) of Parent or any of its officers, managers, directors, partners, members, shareholders or representatives (as applicable). The Restricted Party shall not violate this provision by truthful
statements made (i) in connection with any litigation or arbitration between the Restricted Party and any of the above persons; (ii) as required by applicable law or a governmental or regulatory investigation, or (iii) during
performance reviews in the ordinary course that may contain disparaging or harmful statement concerning employees if relevant to the review.

limitation, the engineering, procurement and construction, and operations and maintenance services in the solar and storage markets, and any other material business engaged in by Parent, or with respect to which Parent has taken any substantial
steps to engage in, during the two year period preceding the Restricted Party’s termination of employment, so long as such business or such steps remain active as of the later of the Closing and such termination of employment.

“
Covered Employee
” means any Person employed by Parent during the Restriction Period.

“
Person
” shall mean any natural person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company, trust, business trust,
or other such entity.

Section 2. Confidentiality.

prior to the Closing with the Seller Parties and/or SOLV and following the Closing, with Parent, and/or by reason of the Restricted Party’s ownership interest prior to the Closing in SI or one of its subsidiaries and following the Closing, in
Parent, the Restricted Party has had and will continue to have access to confidential and proprietary information and trade secrets of Parent in some or all of the followings respects: information with respect to Parent’s bids, projects,
pricing methods and terms, costs, contractors and subcontractors, operations, processes, protocols, products, inventory, ideas, designs, inventions, know-how, engineering methods, proprietary software, business practices, actual and potential
customers and suppliers, marketing methods, contractual relationships, regulatory status, compensation paid to employees or other terms of employment, dealers, distributors, sales representatives, sales, forecasts, projections and long range plans,

2



strategies and techniques, training, service and business manuals, promotional materials, training courses and other training and instructional matters, personnel, plans and opportunities, and
customer, vendor, and supplier data and other business information (collectively, “
Proprietary Information
”). The Restricted Party also agrees that Proprietary Information gained by the Restricted Party during the Restricted
Party’s employment with or service to Parent has been developed by Parent through substantial expenditures of time, effort and money and constitute valuable and unique property of Parent.

(b) The Restricted Party shall maintain in strict confidence and shall not directly or indirectly disseminate, disclose or publish, or use for
his or her benefit or the benefit of any Person (other than Parent) any Proprietary Information or deliver to any Person any document, record, notebook, computer program or similar repository of or containing any Proprietary Information, except in
the course of performance of his or her duties to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, “Proprietary Information” shall not include any information which is in the public domain or otherwise becomes generally
known within Parent’s industry (other than by means of the Restricted Party’s disclosure of such Proprietary Information in violation of the Restricted Party’s obligations under this Agreement).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restricted Party may disclose Proprietary Information in response to a lawful and valid subpoena or
other legal process or a governmental or regulatory investigation but (i) shall give Parent notice thereof as promptly as practicable (to the extent legally permitted), (ii) shall, as much in advance of the return date as reasonably practicable
(to the extent legally permitted), make available to Parent, the documents and other information sought, (iii) shall use reasonable commercial efforts to assist Parent in resisting or otherwise responding to such process at Parent’s sole
cost and expense and (iv) shall limit such disclosures of Proprietary Information to those actually required by such a lawful and valid subpoena or other legal process (and the Restricted Party shall be entitled to rely on the advice of its
counsel for determining what is actually required).

(d) The Restricted Party agrees that upon termination of his or her employment with
Parent for any reason, the Restricted Party shall return to Parent, in good condition, all Proprietary Information, including without limitation, the originals and all copies of any materials which contain, reflect, summarize, describe, analyze or
refer or relate to any items of Proprietary Information, provided that the foregoing shall not prevent the Restricted Party from retaining and utilizing documents relating to the Restricted Party’s personal benefits, entitlements and
obligations, documents relating to personal tax obligations; desk calendar, rolodex, and the like; and such other records and documents as may be approved by Parent in writing.

Section 3. Reasonable Restraint; Injunctive Relief; Savings.


(a) The Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that the Restricted Party’s obligations under this Agreement are reasonable in the
context of the nature of the Business and the injuries likely to be sustained by Parent if the Restricted Party were to violate such obligations.



3



(b) It is recognized and acknowledged by the Restricted Party that a breach of its covenants
in this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to Parent and the goodwill of Parent, that the amount of such damages would be difficult or impossible to ascertain, and that the remedies at law for any such breach would be inadequate. It is also
recognized and acknowledged by the Restricted Party that Parent will not consummate the Transaction without the execution of this Agreement by the Restricted Party. Accordingly, in the event of a breach of any of his or her covenants in this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy which may be available at law or in equity, Parent will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of proof of actual damages.


(c) In the event any term of this Agreement shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason of
its extending for too great a period of time or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, it will be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable and to the maximum extent in all other
respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action. The parties expressly intend for the covenants in this Agreement to be binding in the manner set forth in this Agreement.

4.

distributees, devisees, and legatees, as applicable. Neither Parent nor the Restricted Party may assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the prior consent of the other party;
provided

operating division thereof, are sold or transferred to any Person provided that such transferee assumes the liabilities of Parent hereunder.

Section
5.

.

valid subpoena or other legal process or a governmental or regulatory investigation but (i) shall give Parent notice thereof as promptly as practicable (to the extent legally permitted), (ii) shall, as much in advance of the return date as

its extending for too great a period of time or by reason of its being too extensive in any other respect, it will be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time for which it may be enforceable and to the maximum extent in all other
respects as to which it may be enforceable, all as determined by such court in such action. The parties expressly intend for the covenants in this Agreement to be binding in the manner set forth in this Agreement.

Agreement
”), is made and entered into as of September 10, 2021, by and between SOLV, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “
Company
”), and David Grubb, Jr., an individual
(“
Executive
”).

RECITALS

A.
WHEREAS
, Executive is a key employee of the Company and an integral part of the Company’s management;

B.
WHEREAS
, ASP SRE Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Swinerton Builders, a California corporation, Swinerton
Incorporated, a California corporation, and ASP SRE Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership and the ultimate parent company of the Company (“

AGREEMENT

NOW,
THEREFORE
, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1.
DEFINITIONS
.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in that certain Amended and Restated Limited
Partnership Agreement of Holdings to be entered into as of the Closing in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B
(as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the “
LPA
”). For purposes of this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

1.1. “
Annual Base Salary
” means Executive’s
base annual salary, excluding overtime pay, bonus, income from equity awards, special enhancements, Company-provided fringe and other benefits, and all other amounts of special or nonrecurring compensation, in effect on the date of Executive’s

1.2. “
Section
409A
” means Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and rulings thereunder.

2.
SCOPE OF AGREEMENT


This Agreement provides for the payment of compensation to Executive in the event (1) Executive’s employment is involuntarily
terminated by the Company without Cause, or (2) Executive resigns employment from the Company with Good Reason. If Executive is terminated by the Company for Cause, dies, incurs a Disability or voluntarily terminates employment without Good

Executive agrees that the severance
benefits under this Agreement shall be the only severance benefits payable to Executive by the Company and its affiliates as a result of Executive’s termination of employment and Executive hereby waives Executive’s rights (if any) to any
severance benefits payable under any other agreement, plan or program of the Company and its affiliates to the extent such severance benefits become payable hereunder; provided, that, if severance is not paid due to application of Section 4,

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement is expressly
conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and shall automatically terminate and be void ab initio in the event the Purchase Agreement is terminated or the Closing does not occur for any reason.

Subject to
Section 4 hereof, if (1) Executive’s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause (and such termination does not arise as a result of Executive’s death or Disability), or (2) Executive voluntary
resigns with Good Reason, then, subject to Executive executing and delivering to the Company (without revocation) a valid release of claims in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A
(the “
General Release
”) no later than 21
days following such termination of employment and Executive’s compliance in all material respects with Executive’s covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement, the Restricted Activities Agreement (as defined below) and the
General Release (provided, that, the Company shall provide Executive with written notice of any such noncompliance and not less than 30 days to cure, if curable), Executive shall be entitled to the following:

3.1. the Company shall continue to pay to Executive Executive’s Annual Base Salary, less withholding of all applicable taxes and other
applicable deductions, in accordance with the Company’s regular payroll practices for a period of twelve (12) months commencing on the first payroll date following the effectiveness of the General Release (provided, that, Executive shall
not be treated as an employee while receiving such amounts);



2



3.2. if the termination date occurs on or after the first day of the third quarter of the
fiscal year when such termination date occurs, the Company shall pay Executive a prorated annual bonus for the portion of the fiscal year worked prior to termination of employment based on actual performance achieved as determined as of the end of
such year payable when bonuses are generally paid to other Company executives;

continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“

of such plan) which covers Executive (and Executive’s eligible dependents) for (i) a period of twelve (12) months following Executive’s termination of employment, which shall be paid for by the Company and (ii) a subsequent
period of six (6) months following such initial twelve (12) month period which shall be paid for by Executive but which will be subsidized by the Company (such that Executive’s cost of such COBRA coverage for such six (6) month


period will be the same as Executive would have paid had Executive remained an employee and an active participant in the group health
plan); provided that Executive is eligible and remains eligible for COBRA coverage; and provided, further, that in the event that Executive obtains other employment that offers comparable group health benefits, such continuation of coverage by the
Company under this Section 3.3 shall immediately cease; and

3.4. any earned but unpaid bonus for any prior completed bonus year
shall be payable when otherwise paid to other Company executives.

4.
Negation of Severance Payments and Benefits
.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time within 20 days of
Executive’s termination of employment, elect to terminate all severance payments and benefits hereunder without further obligation to Executive (or to Executive’s eligible dependents, successors, personal representatives, heirs,
beneficiaries or estate), and Executive shall have no further right or claim with respect to such severance payments or benefits (or any claims for losses, costs, fees, damages, debts, or other causes of action arising from or related to any such
election by the Company); provided, that upon any such election, Executive shall be released from any further obligations under the Restricted Activities Agreement, each other Protective Agreement (if any), and the General Release.

5.
SECTION 409A
.

This Agreement and the severance payments and benefits herein are intended to comply with Section 409A or an exemption thereunder and
shall be construed and administered in accordance with such intent. To the extent Section 409A applies, any payments to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a “separation from service”
under Section 409A. If any payment provided to Executive in connection with Executive’s termination of employment is determined to constitute “nonqualified deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A and
Executive is determined to be a “specified employee” as defined in Section 409A, then such payment shall not be paid until the first payroll date following the six-month anniversary of Executive’s termination of employment. To
the extent that any payment of severance benefits constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any payment of any such amount or provision of any benefit otherwise scheduled to occur prior
to the 30th day following the date of termination of employment, but for the condition on executing the General Release as set forth herein, will not be made until the first payroll date following such 30th day, and any remaining payments thereafter
due will be provided to Executive according to the applicable schedule set forth herein (in each case, subject to the satisfaction of such condition). For purposes of Section 409A, each payment under this Agreement will be treated as a separate
payment. In the event the Company and Executive determine that any payment hereunder is not in compliance with Section 409A, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify the arrangement as necessary to be in compliance, preserving, to
the maximum extent possible, the original economic intent of the parties hereunder.

materially affected this General Release and my decision to enter into it. I hereby waive any right or Claim that might exist prior to signing this General Release as a result of the knowledge of such different or additional Claims or facts.

4. I agree that this General Release does not waive or release any rights or Claims that I may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act of 1967 which arise after the date I execute this General Release. I acknowledge and agree that my separation from employment with the Company shall not serve as the basis for any Claim or action (including, without limitation, any claim under
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967). Furthermore, this General Release does not release any Claim that relates to (i) my right to enforce this General Release; (ii) any rights I may have to indemnification from personal
liability or to protection under any insurance policy maintained by the Company, including without limitation any general liability or directors and officers insurance policy and under any other document or agreement, including, without limitation,

filed, or processed any litigation, Claims or proceedings against the Company or any Released Parties, nor have I encouraged or assisted anyone to institute, prosecute, file, or process any litigation, Claims or proceedings against the Company or
any Released Parties. Notwithstanding the above, I further acknowledge that nothing in this General Release is intended to prohibit or restrict my right to file a charge with or participate in a charge by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
or any other local, state, or federal administrative body or government agency;
provided
that I hereby waive the right to recover any monetary damages or other relief against any Released Parties; and

hereinabove mentioned or implied. I expressly consent that this General Release shall be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to unknown and
unsuspected Claims (notwithstanding any state statute that expressly limits the effectiveness of a general release of unknown, unsuspected and unanticipated Claims), if any, as well as those relating to any other Claims hereinabove mentioned or
implied. I acknowledge and agree that this waiver is an essential and material term of this General Release and that without such waiver the Company would not have agreed to the terms of the Severance Agreement. I further agree that in the event I
should bring a Claim seeking damages against the Company or any other Released Party, or in the event I should seek to recover against the Company or any other Released Party in any Claim brought by a governmental agency on my behalf, this General
Release shall serve as a complete defense to such Claims to the maximum extent permitted by law. I further agree that I am not aware of any pending Claim of the type described in paragraph 2 above as of the execution of this General Release.

7. I agree that neither this General Release, nor the furnishing of the consideration for this General Release, shall be deemed or construed

(and each affiliate and person acting on behalf of any such party) agrees that each party (and each employee, representative, and other agent of such party) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and
tax structure of the transactions contemplated in the Severance Agreement and, all materials of any kind

(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party or such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. This authorization is not intended to permit disclosure
of any other information including (without limitation) (i) any portion of any materials to the extent not related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Severance Agreement, (ii) the identities of
participants or potential participants in the Severance Agreement, (iii) any financial information (except to the extent such information is related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Severance
Agreement), or (iv) any other term or detail not relevant to the tax treatment or the tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Severance Agreement.

9. The non-disclosure provisions in this General Release do not prohibit or restrict me (or my attorney) from (a) responding to any
inquiry about this General Release or its underlying facts and circumstances by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., any other self-regulatory organization or governmental entity;
(b) making any disclosure of relevant and necessary information or documents in any action, investigation, or proceeding relating to this General Release or the Severance Agreement, or as required by law or legal process, including with respect

affiliates prohibits or restricts me from initiating communications with, or responding to any inquiry from, any regulatory or supervisory authority regarding any good faith concerns about possible violations of law or regulation. Pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1833(b), I will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret of the Company or its affiliates that (i) is made (x) in confidence to a Federal,
state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to my attorney and (y) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed
under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. If I file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, I may disclose the trade secret to my attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,
if I file any document containing the trade secret under seal, and do not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this General Release or any other agreement between the parties or any other policies of the Company or
its affiliates is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by such section.

13. Notwithstanding anything in this General Release to the contrary, this General Release shall not relinquish, diminish, or in any way
affect any rights or Claims arising out of any breach by the Company of the Severance Agreement after the date hereof.

14. Whenever
possible, each provision of this General Release shall be interpreted in, such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this General Release is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect
under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this General Release shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

Exhibit 10.12

SEVERANCE AGREEMENT

This
Severance Agreement (this “
Agreement
”), is made and entered into as of September 10, 2021, by and between SOLV, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “
Company
”), and Ben Catalano, an individual
(“
Executive
”).

RECITALS

A.
WHEREAS
, Executive is a key employee of the Company and an integral part of the Company’s management;

B.
WHEREAS
, ASP SRE Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Swinerton Builders, a California corporation, Swinerton
Incorporated, a California corporation, and ASP SRE Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership and the ultimate parent company of the Company (“
Holdings
”), are parties to that certain Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated of
even date herewith (the “
Purchase Agreement
”);

C.
WHEREAS
, contingent on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “
Closing
”), the Company desires to provide Executive with certain benefits if Executive’s employment is terminated under certain circumstances; and

D.
WHEREAS
, the Company and Executive have determined it is in their mutual best interest to enter into this Agreement.

AGREEMENT

NOW,
THEREFORE
, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1.
DEFINITIONS
.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in that certain Amended and Restated Limited
Partnership Agreement of Holdings to be entered into as of the Closing in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B
(as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the “
LPA
”). For purposes of this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

1.1. “
Annual Base Salary
” means Executive’s
base annual salary, excluding overtime pay, bonus, income from equity awards, special enhancements, Company-provided fringe and other benefits, and all other amounts of special or nonrecurring compensation, in effect on the date of Executive’s
termination of employment (or, in the case, of a resignation with Good Reason under clause (ii) of the definition thereof in the LPA, as in effect immediately prior to such decrease in base salary).



1



1.2. “
Section
409A
” means Section 409A of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and rulings thereunder.

2.
SCOPE OF AGREEMENT


This Agreement provides for the payment of compensation to Executive in the event (1) Executive’s employment is involuntarily
terminated by the Company without Cause, or (2) Executive resigns employment from the Company with Good Reason. If Executive is terminated by the Company for Cause, dies, incurs a Disability or voluntarily terminates employment without Good
Reason, this Agreement shall terminate, and Executive shall not be entitled to any payments or compensation pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

This Agreement shall not be considered an employment agreement and in no way guarantees Executive the right to continue in the employment of
the Company or its affiliates. Executive’s employment is considered to be employment at will.

Executive agrees that the severance
benefits under this Agreement shall be the only severance benefits payable to Executive by the Company and its affiliates as a result of Executive’s termination of employment and Executive hereby waives Executive’s rights (if any) to any
severance benefits payable under any other agreement, plan or program of the Company and its affiliates to the extent such severance benefits become payable hereunder; provided, that, if severance is not paid due to application of Section 4,
the Company’s normal severance policy shall apply.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement is expressly
conditioned on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and shall automatically terminate and be void ab initio in the event the Purchase Agreement is terminated or the Closing does not occur for any reason.

3.
SEVERANCE BENEFITS


Subject to
Section 4 hereof, if (1) Executive’s employment is involuntarily terminated by the Company without Cause (and such termination does not arise as a result of Executive’s death or Disability), or (2) Executive voluntary
resigns with Good Reason, then, subject to Executive executing and delivering to the Company (without revocation) a valid release of claims in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A
(the “
General Release
”) no later than 21
days following such termination of employment and Executive’s compliance in all material respects with Executive’s covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement, the Restricted Activities Agreement (as defined below) and the
General Release (provided, that, the Company shall provide Executive with written notice of any such noncompliance and not less than 30 days to cure, if curable), Executive shall be entitled to the following:



2



3.1. the Company shall continue to pay to Executive Executive’s Annual Base Salary,
less withholding of all applicable taxes and other applicable deductions, in accordance with the Company’s regular payroll practices for a period of twelve (12) months commencing on the first payroll date following the effectiveness of the
General Release (provided, that, Executive shall not be treated as an employee while receiving such amounts);

3.2. if the termination
date occurs on or after the first day of the third quarter of the fiscal year when such termination date occurs, the Company shall pay Executive a prorated annual bonus for the portion of the fiscal year worked prior to termination of employment
based on actual performance achieved as determined as of the end of such year payable when bonuses are generally paid to other Company executives;

3.3. subject to Executive’s timely election of continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended (“
COBRA
”) continued participation in the Company’s group health plan (to the extent permitted under applicable law and the terms of such plan) which covers Executive (and Executive’s eligible dependents) for (i) a
period of twelve (12) months following Executive’s termination of employment, which shall be paid for by the Company and (ii) a subsequent period of six (6) months following such initial twelve (12) month period which shall
be paid for by Executive but which will be subsidized by the Company (such that Executive’s cost of such COBRA coverage for such six (6) month period will be the same as Executive would have paid had Executive remained an employee and an
active participant in the group health plan); provided that Executive is eligible and remains eligible for COBRA coverage; and provided, further, that in the event that Executive obtains other employment that offers comparable group health benefits,
such continuation of coverage by the Company under this Section 3.3 shall immediately cease; and

3.4. any earned but unpaid bonus
for any prior completed bonus year shall be payable when otherwise paid to other Company executives.

4.
Negation of Severance Payments and
Benefits
.


Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, at any time
within 20 days of Executive’s termination of employment, elect to terminate all severance payments and benefits hereunder without further obligation to Executive (or to Executive’s eligible dependents, successors, personal representatives,
heirs, beneficiaries or estate), and Executive shall have no further right or claim with respect to such severance payments or benefits (or any claims for losses, costs, fees, damages, debts, or other causes of action arising from or related to any
such election by the Company); provided, that upon any such election, Executive shall be released from any further obligations under the Restricted Activities Agreement, each other Protective Agreement (if any), and the General Release.

5.
SECTION 409A
.

This Agreement and the severance payments and benefits herein are intended to comply with Section 409A or an exemption thereunder and
shall be construed and administered in accordance with such intent. To the extent Section 409A applies, any payments to be made under this Agreement upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a “separation from service”
under Section 409A. If any payment provided to Executive in connection with Executive’s termination of employment is determined to constitute “nonqualified deferred compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A and
Executive is determined to be a “specified employee” as defined in Section 409A, then such payment shall not be paid until the first payroll date following the six-month anniversary of Executive’s termination of employment. To
the extent that any payment of severance benefits constitutes “nonqualified deferred compensation” for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, any payment of any such amount or provision of any benefit otherwise scheduled to occur prior
to the 30th day following the date of termination of employment, but for the condition on executing the General Release as set forth herein, will not be made until the first payroll date following such 30th day, and any remaining payments thereafter
due will be provided to Executive according to the applicable schedule set forth herein (in each case, subject to the satisfaction of such condition). For purposes of Section 409A, each payment under this Agreement will be treated as a separate
payment. In the event the Company and Executive determine that any payment hereunder is not in compliance with Section 409A, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify the arrangement as necessary to be in compliance, preserving, to
the maximum extent possible, the original economic intent of the parties hereunder.

Executive agrees that this Agreement is confidential and agrees not to disclose any information regarding
the terms or existence of this Agreement except to Executive’s immediate family and any tax, legal, financial or other advisors or counsel Executive has consulted regarding the meaning or effect hereof or as required by law, and Executive shall
instruct each of the foregoing not to disclose the same to anyone. Executive may also disclose the terms and existence of this Agreement to the extent advised by counsel that such disclosure is required by court order, subpoena, or in response to
the request of a governmental or regulatory entity; provided, that Executive shall, to the extent not prohibited by law, advise the Company of any such disclosure and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment of any
such information disclosed.

GENERAL RELEASE

I, Ben Catalano, in consideration of and subject to the performance by SOLV, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the
“
Company
”), of its obligations under that certain severance agreement, dated as of September 10, 2021, by and between the Company and me (the “
Severance Agreement
”; capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Severance Agreement), do hereby release and forever discharge as of the date hereof the Company, its subsidiaries and its and their affiliates and all present, future and former directors,
officers, agents, representatives, employees, independent contractors, owners, shareholders, members, insurers and benefit plans, assigns, attorneys, predecessors, successors and assigns of the Company, its subsidiaries and its affiliates and the
Company’s direct or indirect owners, including ASP SRE Management Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and Holdings (collectively, in such capacities, the “
Released Parties
”) to the extent provided below.

1. I understand that any payments or benefits paid or granted to me under Section 3 of the Severance Agreement represent, in part,
consideration for signing this General Release and are not salary, wages or benefits to which I was already entitled. I understand and agree that I shall not receive the payments and benefits specified in Section 3 of the Severance Agreement
unless I execute this General Release and do not revoke this General Release within the time period permitted hereafter or breach this General Release. Such payments and benefits shall not be considered compensation for purposes of any employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained or hereafter established by the Company or its affiliates. I also acknowledge and represent that I have received all payments and benefits that I am entitled to receive (as of the date hereof)
by virtue of any employment by the Company and any of the Released Parties.

2. Except as provided in paragraph 4 below, I knowingly and
voluntarily (for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns) release and forever discharge the Company and the other Released Parties from any and all claims, suits, controversies, actions, causes of action, cross-claims,
counter-claims, demands, debts, compensatory damages, liquidated damages, punitive or exemplary damages, other damages, claims for costs and attorneys’ fees, or losses, promises or liabilities of any nature whatsoever in law and in equity, both

out of, or relate to, any agreement and/or any awards, policies, plans, programs or practices of the Released Parties that may apply to me or in which I may participate and/or any rights under bonus, severance, or other plans or programs of Released
Parties and/or any other short-term or long-term cash-based incentive plans or programs of the Released Parties; or (c) arise out of, or relate to, my

3. I represent that I have made no assignment or transfer of any right, Claim, demand,
cause of action, or other matter covered by paragraph 2 above. I represent that I am not aware of any Claim by me other than the Claims that are released by this General Release. I acknowledge that I may hereafter discover Claims or facts in
addition to or different than those which I now know or believe to exist with respect to the subject matter of the release set forth in paragraph 2 above and which, if known or suspected at the time of entering into this General Release, may have
materially affected this General Release and my decision to enter into it. I hereby waive any right or Claim that might exist prior to signing this General Release as a result of the knowledge of such different or additional Claims or facts.

4. I agree that this General Release does not waive or release any rights or Claims that I may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act of 1967 which arise after the date I execute this General Release. I acknowledge and agree that my separation from employment with the Company shall not serve as the basis for any Claim or action (including, without limitation, any claim under

hereinabove mentioned or implied. I expressly consent that this General Release shall be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including, without limitation, those relating to unknown and
unsuspected Claims (notwithstanding any state statute that expressly limits the effectiveness of a general release of unknown, unsuspected and unanticipated Claims), if any, as well as those relating to any other Claims hereinabove mentioned or
implied. I acknowledge and agree that this waiver is an essential and material term of this General Release and that without such waiver the Company would not have agreed to the terms of the Severance Agreement. I further agree that in the event I
should bring a Claim seeking damages against the Company or any other Released Party, or in the event I should seek to recover against the Company or any other Released Party in any Claim brought by a governmental agency on my behalf, this General
Release shall serve as a complete defense to such Claims to the maximum extent permitted by law. I further agree that I am not aware of any pending Claim of the type described in paragraph 2 above as of the execution of this General Release.

7. I agree that neither this General Release, nor the furnishing of the consideration for this General Release, shall be deemed or construed
at any time to be an admission by the Company, any other Released Party or myself of any improper or unlawful conduct.

8. I agree that
this General Release and the Severance Agreement are confidential and agree not to disclose any information regarding the terms of this General Release or the Severance Agreement, except to my immediate family and any tax, legal, financial or other
advisors or counsel I have consulted regarding the meaning or effect hereof or as required by law, and I shall instruct each of the foregoing not to disclose the same to anyone. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
(and each affiliate and person acting on behalf of any such party) agrees that each party (and each employee, representative, and other agent of such party) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and
tax structure of the transactions contemplated in the Severance Agreement and, all materials of any kind

(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party or such person relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. This authorization is not intended to permit disclosure
of any other information including (without limitation) (i) any portion of any materials to the extent not related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Severance Agreement, (ii) the identities of
participants or potential participants in the Severance Agreement, (iii) any financial information (except to the extent such information is related to the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Severance
Agreement), or (iv) any other term or detail not relevant to the tax treatment or the tax structure of the transactions contemplated by the Severance Agreement.

9. The non-disclosure provisions in this General Release do not prohibit or restrict me (or my attorney) from (a) responding to any
inquiry about this General Release or its underlying facts and circumstances by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., any other self-regulatory organization or governmental entity;
(b) making any disclosure of relevant and necessary information or documents in any action, investigation, or proceeding relating to this General Release or the Severance Agreement, or as required by law or legal process, including with respect
to possible violations of law; (c) participating, cooperating, or testifying in any action, investigation, or proceeding with, or providing information to, any governmental agency or legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, and/or
pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; or (d) accepting any U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission awards. In addition, nothing in this General Release or any other agreement between the parties or any other policies of the Company or its
affiliates prohibits or restricts me from initiating communications with, or responding to any inquiry from, any regulatory or supervisory authority regarding any good faith concerns about possible violations of law or regulation. Pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 1833(b), I will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret of the Company or its affiliates that (i) is made (x) in confidence to a Federal,
state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to my attorney and (y) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed
under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. If I file a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, I may disclose the trade secret to my attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,
if I file any document containing the trade secret under seal, and do not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this General Release or any other agreement between the parties or any other policies of the Company or
its affiliates is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by such section.

10. I agree that as of the date hereof, I have returned to the Company any and all property, tangible or intangible, relating to the business
of the Company and its affiliates, which I possessed or had control over at any time (including, but not limited to, company-provided credit cards, work-related passwords, building or office access cards, keys, computer equipment,

telephones, smartphones, laptops, manuals, files, documents, records, software, hard drives, recordings, tapes, reports, work product, customer data base and other data or non-public,
confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information of the Company) and that I shall not retain any copies, compilations, extracts, excerpts, summaries or other notes of any such manuals, files, documents, records, software, customer data base
or other data. If I discover any property of the Company or non-public, confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret information in my possession after my termination of employment, I shall promptly return such property to the Company or, at the
instruction of the Company, destroy such property or information. For the avoidance of doubt, I may retain copies of my contacts list, calendar and any files or records needed for my personal income tax returns.

11. I hereby confirm all of my obligations under the Restricted Activities Agreement and each Protective Agreement (as defined in the LPA).


12. I shall not knowingly encourage, counsel or assist any non-governmental attorneys or their clients in the presentation or prosecution
of any disputes, differences, grievances, Claims, charges or complaints by any non-governmental third party against any of the Released Parties, without requiring said parties to issue a subpoena, summons or warrant.

13. Notwithstanding anything in this General Release to the contrary, this General Release shall not relinquish, diminish, or in any way
affect any rights or Claims arising out of any breach by the Company of the Severance Agreement after the date hereof.

14. Whenever
possible, each provision of this General Release shall be interpreted in, such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this General Release is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect
under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or any other jurisdiction, but this General Release shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein.

15. Section 7 of the Severance
Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference herein.
