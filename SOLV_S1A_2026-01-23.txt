SOLV Energy, Inc.

[●] Shares
of Class A Common Stock

Underwriting Agreement

[●], 2026

Jefferies LLC

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

As Representatives of the several
Underwriters listed in Schedule 1 hereto

c/o Jefferies LLC

c/o J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

270 Park Avenue

New York, New York 10017

Ladies and Gentlemen:

SOLV Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), proposes to issue and sell to the several underwriters listed in
Schedule 1 hereto (the “Underwriters”), for whom you are acting as representatives (the “Representatives”), an aggregate of [●] shares of Class A common stock, par value $[●] per share (the
“Class A Common Stock”), of the Company (the “Underwritten Shares”) and, at the option of the Underwriters, up to an additional [●] shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Option Shares”). The
Underwritten Shares and the Option Shares are herein referred to as the “Shares”. The shares of Class A Common Stock to be outstanding after giving effect to the sale of the Shares are referred to herein as the “Stock”.


The Company was formed in contemplation of the proposed issuance and sale of the Shares (the “Offering”). It is understood
and agreed to by all parties that the Company will, prior to the closing of the Offering, enter into certain organizational transactions described under the heading “Our Organizational Structure — Transactions” in the Registration
Statement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus (each as defined herein) (the “Organizational Transactions”). Following the Offering and the Organizational Transactions, the Company will be a holding company whose principal
asset will consist of a [●]% equity interest in SOLV Energy Holdings LLC (“Opco LLC” and, together with the Company, the “Company Parties”), with such equity interest consisting of [●] common units of Opco LLC
(“Opco LLC Interests”), representing approximately [●]% of the economic interest in Opco LLC (or [●] Opco LLC Interests, representing approximately [●]% of the economic interest in Opco LLC if the underwriters exercise
in full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A Common Stock). After the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Prospectus, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company will be the sole managing member of Opco LLC and
the Company, through the managing member, will control the business and affairs of Opco LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Through Opco LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the Company will conduct its business. References herein
to the “Company and its subsidiaries” refer to Company and its subsidiaries pro forma following the Organizational Transactions.



The Company Parties hereby confirm their agreement with the several Underwriters concerning
the purchase and sale of the Shares, as follows:

1.
Registration Statement
. The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the “Securities Act”), a registration statement on Form
S-1
(File
No. 333-292778),
including a prospectus, relating to the Shares. Such registration statement, as amended at the time it became effective, including the
information, if any, deemed pursuant to Rule 430A, 430B or 430C under the Securities Act to be part of the registration statement at the time of its effectiveness (“Rule 430 Information”), is referred to herein as the “Registration
Statement”; and as used herein, the term “Preliminary Prospectus” means each prospectus included in such registration statement (and any amendments thereto) before effectiveness, any prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to
Rule 424(a) under the Securities Act and the prospectus included in the Registration Statement at the time of its effectiveness that omits Rule 430 Information, and the term “Prospectus” means the prospectus in the form first used (or
made available upon request of purchasers pursuant to Rule 173 under the Securities Act) in connection with confirmation of sales of the Shares. If the Company has filed an abbreviated registration statement pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the
Securities Act (the “Rule 462 Registration Statement”), then any reference herein to the term “Registration Statement” shall be deemed to include such Rule 462 Registration Statement. Capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

At or prior to the Applicable Time
(as defined below), the Company had prepared the following information (collectively with the pricing information set forth on Annex A, the “Pricing Disclosure Package”): a Preliminary Prospectus dated [●], 2026 and each
“free-writing prospectus” (as defined pursuant to Rule 405 under the Securities Act) listed on Annex A hereto.

“Applicable Time” means [●] [A/P].M., New York City time, on [●], 2026.

2.
Purchase of the Shares
.

(a) The Company agrees to issue and sell the Underwritten Shares to the several Underwriters as provided in this underwriting agreement (this
“Agreement”), and each Underwriter, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase at a price per share of
$[●] (the “Purchase Price”) from the Company the respective number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite such Underwriter’s name in Schedule 1 hereto.

In addition, the Company agrees to issue and sell the Option Shares to the several Underwriters as provided in this Agreement, and the
Underwriters, on the basis of the representations, warranties and agreements set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth herein, shall have the option to purchase, severally and not jointly, from the Company the Option Shares at the
Purchase Price less an amount per share equal to any dividends or distributions declared by the Company and payable on the Underwritten Shares but not payable on the Option Shares.



If any Option Shares are to be purchased, the number of Option Shares to be purchased by
each Underwriter shall be the number of Option Shares which bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of Option Shares being purchased as the number of Underwritten Shares set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter in Schedule 1 hereto (or
such number increased as set forth in Section 10 hereof) bears to the aggregate number of Underwritten Shares being purchased from the Company by the several Underwriters, subject, however, to such adjustments to eliminate any fractional Shares
as the Representatives in their sole discretion shall make.

The Underwriters may exercise the option to purchase Option Shares at any
time in whole, or from time to time in part, on or before the thirtieth day following the date of the Prospectus, by written notice from the Representatives to the Company. Such notice shall set forth the aggregate number of Option Shares as to
which the option is being exercised and the date and time when the Option Shares are to be delivered and paid for, which may be the same date and time as the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) but shall not be earlier than the Closing Date nor
later than the tenth full business day (as hereinafter defined) after the date of such notice (unless such time and date are postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10 hereof). Any such notice shall be given at least two business
days prior to the date and time of delivery specified therein.

(b) The Company understands that the Underwriters intend to make a public
offering of the Shares, and initially to offer the Shares on the terms set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters may offer and sell Shares to or through any affiliate of an Underwriter.


(c) Payment for the Shares shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified by the Company to the
Representatives in the case of the Underwritten Shares, at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020, at 10:00 A.M. New York City time on [●], 2026, or at such other time or place on
the same or such other date, not later than the fifth business day thereafter, as the Representatives and the Company may agree upon in writing or, in the case of the Option Shares, on the date and at the time and place specified by the
Representatives in the written notice of the Underwriters’ election to purchase such Option Shares. The time and date of such payment for the Underwritten Shares is referred to herein as the “Closing Date”, and the time and date
for such payment for the Option Shares, if other than the Closing Date, is herein referred to as the “Additional Closing Date”.

Payment for the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall be made against delivery
to the Representatives for the respective accounts of the several Underwriters of the Shares to be purchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, with any transfer taxes payable in connection with the sale of such
Shares duly paid by the Company. Delivery of the Shares shall be made through the facilities of The Depository Trust Company unless the Representatives shall otherwise instruct.



(d) The Company acknowledges and agrees that the Representatives and the other Underwriters
are acting solely in the capacity of an arm’s length contractual counterparty to the Company with respect to the offering of Shares contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the terms of the Offering) and not as a financial
advisor or a fiduciary to, or an agent of, the Company or any other person. Additionally, neither the Representatives nor any other Underwriter is advising the Company or any other person as to any legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory
matters in any jurisdiction. The Company shall consult with its own advisors concerning such matters and shall be responsible for making its own independent investigation and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the
Representatives nor the other Underwriters shall have any responsibility or liability to the Company with respect thereto. Any review by the Representatives and the other Underwriters of the Company, the transactions contemplated hereby or other
matters relating to such transactions will be performed solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and shall not be on behalf of the Company.

3.

the Commission, and each Preliminary Prospectus included in the Pricing Disclosure Package, at the time of filing thereof, complied in all material respects with the Securities Act, and no Preliminary Prospectus, at the time of filing thereof,

Testing-the-Waters
Communication is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading; and (vii) of the
receipt by the Company of any notice with respect to any suspension of the qualification of the Shares for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and
the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, preventing or suspending the use of any Preliminary Prospectus, any of the Pricing Disclosure

Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls such Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, reasonable and documented legal fees and other reasonable and documented expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and
expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or caused by any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, not misleading, or (ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any “issuer information” filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, any Written
Testing-the-Waters
Communication prepared, distributed or authorized by the Company, any road show as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act (a “road
show”) or any Pricing Disclosure Package (including any Pricing Disclosure Package that has subsequently been amended), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein, it being understood and
agreed that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the information described as such in paragraph (b) below.

(b)
Indemnification of the Company Parties.
Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each
Company Party, its directors, its officers who signed the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls a Company Party within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same
extent as the indemnity set forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in
reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company in writing by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus (or any amendment
or supplement thereto), any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, any Written
Testing-the-Waters
Communication, any road show or any Pricing
Disclosure Package (including any Pricing Disclosure Package that has subsequently been amended), it being understood and agreed upon that the only such information furnished by any Underwriter consists of the following information in the Prospectus
furnished on behalf of each Underwriter: the concession and reallowance figures appearing in the [●] paragraph under the caption “Underwriting” and the information contained in the [●] paragraph under the caption
“Underwriting”



(c)
Notice and Procedures.
If any suit, action, proceeding (including any
governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this Section 7, such person (the
“Indemnified Person”) shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the “Indemnifying Person”) in writing;
provided
that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not
relieve it from any liability that it may have under the preceding paragraphs of this Section 7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and

provided
,
further
, that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under the preceding paragraphs of this Section 7. If any such
proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person (who shall not, without
the consent of the Indemnified Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and
shall pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the contrary;
(ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available
to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related
proceeding in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all such reasonable and documented fees and
expenses shall be paid or reimbursed promptly after they are incurred. Any such separate firm for any Underwriter, its affiliates, directors and officers and any control persons of such Underwriter shall be designated in writing by the
Representatives and any such separate firm for the Company Parties, their directors, their officers who signed the Registration Statement and any control persons of a Company Party shall be designated in writing by the Company. The Indemnifying
Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, but if settled with such consent, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify
each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified
Person for reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is
entered into more than 45 days after receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall not have



reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect
any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as
to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

(d)
Contribution.
If the
indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) or (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such
paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Company Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, in connection with the statements or
omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be
deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company Parties from the sale of the Shares and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters in
connection therewith, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company Parties, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other, shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company Parties or by the
Underwriters and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

(e)
Limitation on Liability.
The Company Parties and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to paragraph (d) above were determined by
pro

rata
allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any reasonable and documented legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e), in no event shall an
Underwriter be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter with respect to the offering of the Shares exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters’ obligations to contribute pursuant to paragraphs (d) and (e) are several in proportion to their respective
purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.



(f)
Non-Exclusive
Remedies.
The remedies
provided for in this Section 7 paragraphs (a) through (e) are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

8.
Effectiveness of Agreement
. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date first written above.

9.
Termination
. This Agreement may be terminated in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice to the Company Parties,
if after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date or, in the case of the Option Shares, prior to the Additional Closing Date (i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on or by
any of the New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market; (ii) trading of any securities issued or guaranteed by any Company Party shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any
over-the-counter
market; (iii) a general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any outbreak
or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the judgment of the Representatives, is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to
proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Shares on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Prospectus.

10.
Defaulting Underwriter
.

(a) If, on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, any Underwriter defaults on its obligation to purchase the
Shares that it has agreed to purchase hereunder on such date, the
non-defaulting
Underwriters may in their discretion arrange for the purchase of such Shares by other persons satisfactory to the Company on the
terms contained in this Agreement. If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the
non-defaulting
Underwriters do not arrange for the purchase of such Shares, then the Company shall be
entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the
non-defaulting
Underwriters to purchase such Shares on such terms. If other persons become obligated or agree
to purchase the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter, either the
non-defaulting
Underwriters or the Company may postpone the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, for up to five full
business days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company
agrees to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus that effects any such changes. As used in this Agreement, the term “Underwriter” includes, for all purposes of this Agreement unless
the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 10, purchases Shares that a defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase.



(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
non-defaulting
Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or
the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, does not exceed
one-eleventh
of the aggregate number of Shares to be purchased on such date, then the Company shall have the right to require each
non-defaulting
Underwriter to purchase the number of Shares that such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder on such date plus such Underwriter’s pro rata share (based on the number of Shares that such
Underwriter agreed to purchase on such date) of the Shares of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made.

(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Shares of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
non-defaulting
Underwriters and the Company as provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate number of Shares that remain unpurchased on the Closing Date or the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be,
exceeds
one-eleventh
of the aggregate amount of Shares to be purchased on such date, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement or, with respect
to any Additional Closing Date, the obligation of the Underwriters to purchase Shares on the Additional Closing Date, as the case may be, shall terminate without liability on the part of the
non-defaulting

Underwriters. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of the Company Parties, except that the Company Parties will continue to be liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in
Section 11 hereof and except that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in effect.

(d)
Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company Parties or any
non-defaulting
Underwriter for damages caused by its default.

11.

(b) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9, (ii) the Company for any reason fails to tender the Shares for

Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby; provided that in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10(c) hereto, the Company shall only reimburse the

purchase.

Energy, Inc.

16680 West Bernardo Drive

San Diego, CA 92127


Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to SOLV
Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), in connection with the preparation and filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form

S-1,
File
No. 333-292778,
as amended, and including any subsequent registration statement on Form
S-1
filed pursuant to Rule
462(b), (the “Registration Statement”), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), relating to the registration of the offer, issuance and sale by the Company of the number of shares of Class A common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”) of the Company specified in the Registration Statement (together with any additional shares of Class A Common Stock that may be sold by the Company pursuant to
Rule 462(b) under the Act, the “Shares”). The Shares are to be issued and sold by the Company pursuant to an underwriting agreement among the Company, SOLV Energy Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Jefferies LLC and J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (the “Underwriting Agreement”), the form of which will be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the Registration Statement.

In so acting, we have examined originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of (i) the form of the Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware prior to the consummation of the initial public offering contemplated by the Registration Statement, filed as Exhibit 3.2 to the
Registration Statement; (ii) the form of Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company to be in effect at the time of the consummation of the initial public offering contemplated by the Registration Statement, filed as Exhibit 3.2 to the
Registration Statement, (iii) the Registration Statement; (iv) the prospectus contained within the Registration Statement; (v) the form of the Underwriting Agreement; (vi) the form of the Specimen Stock Certificate evidencing the
Class A Common Stock, filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the Registration Statement; and (vii) such corporate records, agreements, documents and other instruments, and such certificates or comparable documents of public officials and of officers and
representatives of the Company, and have made such inquiries of such officers and representatives, as we have deemed relevant and necessary as a basis for the opinion hereinafter set forth.

In such examination, we have assumed that the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that will be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware will be substantially identical to the form of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reviewed by us, the Amended and Restated Bylaws that will be in effect at the time of the
consummation of the initial public offering contemplated by the Registration Statement will be substantially identical to the form of the Amended and Restated Bylaws reviewed by us, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all
natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified, conformed or photostatic copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such
latter documents. As to all questions of fact material to this opinion that have not been independently established, we have relied upon certificates or comparable documents of officers and representatives of the Company.

Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications stated herein, we are of the opinion that the Shares, when issued and sold as contemplated in the
Registration Statement and the Underwriting Agreement, and upon payment and delivery in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable.


The opinion expressed herein is limited to the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and we express no opinion as to the effect on the matters covered by
this letter of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

We hereby consent to the filing of this letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement, to the
incorporation by reference of this letter into any subsequent registration statement on Form
S-1
filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 462(b) of the Act with respect to the Shares and to the reference to our
firm under the caption “Legal Matters” in the prospectus which is a part of the Registration Statement. In giving such consent we do not hereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7
of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Very truly yours,

Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees
.
If at any time or from time to time, in connection
with any Corporate Equity Incentive Plan, any shares of Class A Common Stock are issued to an Employee (including any shares of Class A Common Stock that are subject to forfeiture in the event such Employee terminates his or her employment
with the Company or any Subsidiary or any shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection with the settlement of restricted stock units or performance stock units) in consideration for services performed for the Company or any Subsidiary:


(i) PubCo shall issue such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as are to be issued to such Employee in accordance with the
Corporate Equity Incentive Plan;

(ii) On the date
that the Value of such shares is includible in taxable income of such
Employee (such date, the “
Vesting
Date
”), the following events will be deemed to have occurred: (1) PubCo shall be deemed to have sold such shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company
(or if such Employee is an employee of, or other service provider to, a Subsidiary, to such Subsidiary) for a purchase price equal to the Value of such shares of Class A Common Stock, (2) the Company (or such Subsidiary) shall be deemed to
have delivered such shares of Class A Common Stock to such Employee, (3) PubCo shall be deemed to have contributed the purchase price for such shares of Class A Common Stock to the Company as a Capital Contribution, and (4) in
the case where such Employee is an employee of a Subsidiary, the Company shall be deemed to have contributed such amount to the capital of the Subsidiary; and



26



(iii) The Company shall issue to PubCo on the Vesting Date a number of Common Units equal to
the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued under
Section
3.10(c)(i)
in consideration for a Capital Contribution that PubCo is deemed to make to the Company pursuant to clause (3) of

Section
3.10(c)(ii)
above.

The number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued to the Employee under
Section
3.10(c)(i)
, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock sold to the Company or a Subsidiary under Section
3.10(c)(ii)(1)
, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock delivered to the Employee under

Section
3.10(c)(ii)(2)
, and the number of Common Units received by PubCo under
Section
3.10(c)(iii)

elects to net settle in connection with the Vesting Date.

The provisions of
Section
3.10(b)
and this

Section
3.10(c)
are intended to be consistent with the operation of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1032-3
and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(d)
Future Equity Incentive Plans
.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or applied to preclude or restrain PubCo
from adopting, modifying or terminating equity incentive plans for the benefit of employees, directors or other business associates of PubCo, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. The Members acknowledge and agree that, in the event
that any such plan is adopted, modified or terminated by PubCo, amendments to this
Section
3.10
may become necessary or advisable and that any approval or consent to any such amendments requested by PubCo shall be deemed
granted by the Manager and the Members, as applicable, without the requirement of any further consent or acknowledgement of any other Member. In the event that any employee share purchase plan or similar plan is adopted by PubCo,

Section
3.10(b)
shall be applied to any share purchases thereunder
mutatis mutandis
.

(e)

Anti-dilution adjustments
.
For all purposes of this
Section
3.10
, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and the corresponding number of Common Units shall be determined after giving effect
to all anti-dilution or similar adjustments that are applicable, as of the date of exercise or vesting, to the option, warrant, restricted stock or other equity interest that is being exercised or becomes vested under the applicable Corporate Equity
Incentive Plan and applicable award or grant documentation.

Section 3.11.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan or Other Plan
. Except as
may otherwise be provided in this
Article III
, all amounts received or deemed received by PubCo in respect of any dividend reinvestment plan or other stock or subscription plan or agreement, if any, either (a) shall be utilized by PubCo
to effect open market purchases of shares of Class A Common Stock, or (b) if PubCo elects instead to issue new shares of Class A Common Stock with respect to such amounts, shall be contributed by PubCo to the Company in exchange for a
number of additional Common Units equal to the number of new shares of Class A Common Stock so issued. In connection with any transaction described in this
Section
3.11
, the Manager shall be permitted to cause the
Company to make such issuances or redemptions of Common Units, or make such adjustments to the capitalization of the Company, as necessary to preserve the
one-to-one

ratios described in
Section
3.04(a)(i)
.

ARTICLE IV

DISTRIBUTIONS

Section 4.01.
Distributions
.


(a)
Distributable Cash; Other Distributions
.
To the extent permitted by applicable Law and hereunder, Distributions to
Members may be declared by the Manager out of Distributable Cash or other funds or property legally available therefor in such amounts, at such time and on such terms (including the payment dates of such Distributions) as the Manager in its sole
discretion shall determine using such record date as the Manager may designate. All Distributions made under this
Section
4.01
shall be made to the Members as of the close of business on such record date on
a pro rata

basis in accordance with each Member’s Percentage Interest;
provided, however,
that the Manager shall have the obligation to make Distributions as set forth in
Sections 4.01(b)
and
14.02
;
provided
,

further
, that if any Vested Units or Unvested Units are forfeited as a result of the forfeiture of the Corresponding Management Units, the former Member holding such Units shall have no right to receive any further Distributions with respect
to such Units. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no Distributions shall be made to any Member to the extent such Distribution would render the Company insolvent or violate the Delaware Act. For purposes of the foregoing
sentence, insolvency means the inability of the Company to meet its payment obligations when due.

(b)
Tax Distributions
.
With respect to each Taxable Year, the Company shall, to the extent of available cash and subject to any restrictions under applicable Law or the terms of any Credit Agreement, make cash distributions (“
Tax
Distributions
”)
to each Member, pro rata, in accordance with each Member’s Percentage Interest (based on Units held at the time of the applicable Tax Distribution) at such times and in such amounts as necessary
for (x) each Member to receive an amount of Tax Distributions at least equal to such Member’s Assumed Tax Liability and (y) PubCo to meet its obligations pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In the event of any Transfer of any
or all of a Member’s Units, such Member’s Assumed Tax Liability will be equitably adjusted, in the Manager’s reasonable discretion in consultation with the AS Representative, based on the Units Transferred and the Units retained
(if any). The Company shall make such Tax Distributions based on estimated information on or prior to each Tax Distribution Date with respect to the applicable Taxable Year. If, after the allocation of the Company’s net taxable income or loss
has been determined for a Taxable Year, a Member has a shortfall in the amount of Tax Distributions that such Member received with respect to such Taxable Year, the Company shall make additional Tax Distributions to the Members, pro rata in
accordance with each Member’s Percentage Interest (based on Units held at the time of the additional Tax Distributions), until such Member receives an amount at least equal to such shortfall. The amount of Tax Distributions required to be made
in respect of any Taxable Year shall be computed as if any distribution made pursuant to
Section
4.01(a)
during such Taxable Year were a Tax Distribution in respect of such Taxable Year. To the extent that the Company has
insufficient available cash to make, or applicable Law or the terms of any Credit Agreement prevent the Company from making, the full amount of Tax Distributions required by this
Section
4.01(b)
, each



28



Member’s Tax Distributions shall be reduced proportionately based on the amount of Tax Distributions such Member would have received absent such shortage of available cash or the existence
of such restrictions and the Company shall make future Tax Distributions in respect of such reduction as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company obtains sufficient available cash or such restrictions are no longer applicable.

(c)
Transfer of Units
. If all or a portion of a Member’s Units are transferred, sold or otherwise disposed, then the
transferor shall have no right to receive any further Distributions under
Section
4.01(a)
in respect of such transferred Units and any subsequent Distributions to the transferee shall be determined with regard to amounts
previously distributed to the transferor.

ARTICLE V

CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; ALLOCATIONS; TAX MATTERS

Section 5.01.
Capital Accounts
.

(a) The Company shall maintain a separate Capital Account for each Member according to the rules of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).
For this purpose, the Company may (in the discretion of the Manager), upon the occurrence of the events specified in Treasury Regulation

Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)
(or any other event to the extent determined by the Manager to be permitted under applicable law), increase or decrease the Book Values of the Company’s properties and
the Capital Accounts in accordance with the rules of such Treasury Regulation and Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g)
(and any other applicable Treasury Regulations under Code
Section 704(b)) to reflect a revaluation of the Company’s property.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of
income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to the Company to be allocated pursuant to this
Article V
and to be reflected in the Capital Accounts of the Members, the determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the
same as its determination, recognition and classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any method of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization used for this purpose);
provided, however,
that:

(i) The computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall include those items described in Code Section 705(a)(1)(B) or
Code Section 705(a)(2)(B) and Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i),
without regard to the fact that such items are not includible in gross income or are not deductible for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

(ii) If the Book Value of any property of the Company is adjusted pursuant to

Section
5.01(a)
or Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e),
the amount of such adjustment shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of such
property.

(iii) Items of income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to the disposition of property of the Company having a Book Value
that differs from its adjusted basis for tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the Book Value of such property.



29



(iv) Items of depreciation, amortization and other cost recovery deductions with respect to
property of the Company having a Book Value that differs from its adjusted basis for tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the property’s Book Value in accordance with Treasury Regulation

Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g).


(v) To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of
any asset of the Company pursuant to Code Sections 732(d), 734(b) or 743(b) is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m),
to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis).

Section 5.02.
Allocations
. Except as otherwise provided in
Section
5.03
and

Section
5.04
(and excluding any Profits or Losses allocated pursuant to such sections), Net Profits and Net Losses for any Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period (and to the extent determined necessary and appropriate by the
Manager, any allocable items of gross income, gain, loss and expense includable in the computation of Profits and Losses) shall be allocated among the Members in a manner such that, after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in

Section
5.03
and all Distributions through the end of such Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period, the Capital Account balances of the Members (for this purpose, increasing a Member’s Capital Account balance by such
Member’s share of Minimum Gain or Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain) are, as nearly as possible, pro rata in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

Section 5.03.
Regulatory Allocations
.

(a) Losses attributable to partner nonrecourse debt (as defined in Treasury Regulation

Section 1.704-2(b)(4))
shall be allocated in the manner required by Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i).
If there is a net decrease during a Taxable Year or
other Fiscal Period in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, Profits for such Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period (and, if necessary, for subsequent Taxable Years or other Fiscal Periods) shall be allocated to the Members in the amounts and of such
character as determined according to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(i)(4).
This
Section
5.03(a)
is intended to be a partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain chargeback
provision that complies with the requirements of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(i)
and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.

(b) Nonrecourse deductions (as determined according to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(c))
for
any Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period shall be allocated pro rata among the Members in accordance with their Percentage Interests. If there is a net decrease in the Minimum Gain during any Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period, each Member shall be
allocated Profits for such Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period (and, if necessary, for subsequent Taxable Years or other Fiscal Periods) in the amounts and of such character as determined according to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(f).
This
Section
5.03(b)
is intended to be a minimum gain chargeback provision that complies with the requirements of Treasury Regulation

Section 1.704-2(f)
and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.



30



(c) If any Member that unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or distribution
described in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
(5) or (6) has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as of the end of any Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period, computed after the
application of
Sections 5.03(a)
and
5.03(b)
but before the application of any other provision of this
Article V
, then Profits for such Taxable Year or other Fiscal Period shall be allocated to such Member in proportion to, and
to the extent of, such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. This
Section
5.03(c)
is intended to be a qualified income offset provision as described in Treasury Regulation

Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)
and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent therewith.

(d)
If the allocation of Net Losses to a Member as provided in
Section
5.02
would create or increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, there shall be allocated to such Member only that amount of Losses as will not create or
increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. The Net Losses that would, absent the application of the preceding sentence, otherwise be allocated to such Member shall be allocated to the other Members in accordance with their relative Percentage
Interests, subject to this
Section
5.03(d)
.

(e) Profits and Losses described in

Section
5.01(b)(v)
shall be allocated in a manner consistent with the manner that the adjustments to the Capital Accounts are required to be made pursuant to Treasury Regulation

Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m).


(f) The allocations set forth in

Section
5.03(a)
through and including
Section
5.03(e)
(the “
Regulatory Allocations
”)
are intended to comply with certain requirements of Sections
1.704-1(b)
and
1.704-2
of the Treasury Regulations. The Regulatory Allocations may not be consistent with the manner in which the Members intend to allocate Profit and Loss of
the Company or make Distributions. Accordingly, notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Article V,
but subject to the Regulatory Allocations, income, gain, deduction and loss with respect to the Company may, in the reasonable discretion
of the Manager, be reallocated among the Members so as to eliminate the effect of the Regulatory Allocations and thereby cause the respective Capital Accounts of the Members to be in the amounts (or as close thereto as possible) they would have been
if Profit and Loss (and such other items of income, gain, deduction and loss) had been allocated without reference to the Regulatory Allocations. In general, the Members anticipate that this will be accomplished by specially allocating other Profit
and Loss (and such other items of income, gain, deduction and loss) among the Members so that the net amount of the Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to each such Member is zero.

Section 5.04.
Final Allocations
. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this Agreement except

Section
5.03
, the Manager may make appropriate adjustments to allocations of Profits and Losses to (or, if necessary, allocate items of gross income, gain, loss or deduction of the Company among) the Members upon the
liquidation of the Company (within the meaning of
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)
of the Treasury Regulations), the transfer of substantially all the Units (whether by sale or exchange or merger) or sale of
all or substantially all the assets of the Company, such that, to the maximum extent possible, the Capital Accounts of the Members are proportionate to their Percentage Interests. In each case, such adjustments or allocations shall occur, to the
maximum extent possible, in the Taxable Year of the event requiring such adjustments or allocations.



31



Section 5.05.
Tax Allocations
.

(a) Except as provided in
Section
5.05(b)
,
Section
5.05(c)
and

Section
5.05(d)
, the income, gains, losses and deductions of the Company will be allocated, for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, among the Members in accordance with the allocation of such income, gains,
losses and deductions among the Members for purposes of computing their Capital Accounts;
provided
that if any such allocation is not permitted by the Code or other applicable Law, the Company’s subsequent income, gains, losses and
deductions will be allocated among the Members so as to reflect as nearly as possible the allocation set forth herein in computing their Capital Accounts.

(b) Items of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction of the Company with respect to any property contributed to the Company shall be allocated
among the Members in accordance with Code Section 704(c) so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its Book Value using any method permitted under
applicable Law (including the traditional method with curative allocations under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.704-3(c),
with the curative allocations applied only to gain from the sale of such
contributed property), with such choice of method to be determined in the discretion of the Company with the consent of the AS Representative.

(c) If the Book Value of any asset of the Company is adjusted pursuant to
Section
5.01(a)
, including adjustments to
the Book Value of any asset of the Company in connection with the IPO, subsequent allocations of items of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such
asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its Book Value using any method permitted under applicable Law (including the traditional method with curative allocations under Treasury Regulations

Section 1.704-3(c),
with the curative allocations applied only to gain from the sale of the asset of the Company whose Book Value was adjusted), with such choice of method to be determined in the
discretion of the Company with the consent of the AS Representative.

(d) Allocations of tax credits, tax credit recapture, and any items
related thereto shall be allocated to the Members as reasonably determined by the Manager taking into account the principles of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).


(e) For purposes of determining a Member’s share of the Company’s “excess nonrecourse liabilities” within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.752-3(a)(3),
each Member’s share of profits shall be determined pursuant to any proper method, as reasonably determined by the Manager with an objective of
minimizing gain recognition under Section 731 of the Code to any direct or indirect partner.

(f) Allocations pursuant to this

Section
5.05
are solely for purposes of U.S. federal, state and local taxes and shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Member’s Capital Account or share of Profits, Losses,
Distributions or other items of the Company pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.



32



Section 5.06.
Indemnification and Reimbursement for Payments on Behalf of a
Member
. If the Company is obligated to pay any amount to a Governmental Entity (or otherwise makes a payment to a Governmental Entity) that is specifically attributable to a Member or a Member’s status as such (including any amounts
payable by the Company pursuant to the Partnership Tax Audit Rules, U.S. federal withholding taxes, state personal property taxes and state unincorporated business taxes, but excluding payments such as payroll taxes, withholding taxes, benefits or
professional association fees and the like required to be made or made voluntarily by the Company on behalf of any Member based upon such Member’s status as an employee of the Company), then such Member shall indemnify the Company in full for
the entire amount paid (including interest, penalties and related expenses). The Manager may offset Distributions to which a Member is otherwise entitled under this Agreement against such Member’s obligation to indemnify the Company under this

Section
5.06
and such Member shall be treated as receiving the full amount of such offset for the purposes of this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each Member agrees that any Cash
Settlement such Member is entitled to receive pursuant to
Article XI
may be offset by an amount equal to such Member’s obligation to indemnify the Company under this
Section
5.06
and that such Member shall be
treated as receiving the full amount of such Cash Settlement and paying to the Company an amount equal to such obligation. A Member’s obligation to make payments to the Company under this
Section
5.06
shall survive
the transfer or termination of any Member’s interest in any Units of the Company, the termination of this Agreement and the dissolution, liquidation, winding up and termination of the Company. In the event that the Company has been terminated
prior to the date such payment is due, such Member shall make such payment to the Manager (or its designee), which shall distribute such funds in accordance with this Agreement. The Company may pursue and enforce all rights and remedies it may have
against each Member under this
Section
5.06,
including instituting a lawsuit to collect such contribution with interest calculated at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base Rate plus 300 basis points (but not in
excess of the highest rate per annum permitted by Law). Each Member shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to the Company such information and forms as required or reasonably requested in order to comply with any Laws governing
withholding of tax or in order to claim any reduced rate of, or exemption from, withholding to which the Member is legally entitled. The Company may withhold any amount that it determines is required to be withheld from any amount otherwise payable
to any Member hereunder, and any such withheld amount shall be deemed to have been paid to such Member for purposes of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VI

MANAGEMENT

Section 6.01.
Authority of Manager; Officer Delegation
.

(a) Except for situations in which the approval or determination of any Member(s) is specifically required by this Agreement, (i) all
management powers over the business and affairs of the Company shall be exclusively vested in Manager Sub, as the sole managing member of the Company (Manager Sub, in such capacity, the
“
Manager
”)
,
(ii) the Manager shall conduct, direct and exercise full control over all activities of the Company and (iii) no other Member shall have any right, authority or power to vote,
consent or approve any matter, whether under the Delaware Act, this Agreement or otherwise. The Manager shall be the “manager” of the Company for the purposes of the Delaware Act. Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein and
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Members hereby consent to the exercise by the Manager of all such powers and rights conferred on the Members by the Delaware Act with respect to the management and control of the Company. Any
vacancies in the position of Manager shall be filled in accordance with
Section
6.04
.



33



(b) Without limiting the authority of the Manager to act on behalf of the Company, the
day-to-day
business and operations of the Company shall be overseen and implemented by officers of the Company (each, an
“
Officer
”
and collectively, the “
Officers
”)
,
subject to the limitations imposed by the Manager. An Officer may, but need not, be a Member. Each Officer
shall be appointed by the Manager and shall hold office until his or her successor shall be duly designated and shall qualify or until his or her death or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter provided.
Any one Person may hold more than one office. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement (including in
Section
6.07
below), the salaries or other compensation, if any, of the Officers of the Company shall be fixed
from time to time by the Manager. The authority and responsibility of the Officers shall be limited to such duties as the Manager may, from time to time, delegate to them. Unless the Manager decides otherwise, if the title is one commonly used for
officers of a business corporation formed under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the assignment of such title shall constitute the delegation to such person of the authorities and duties that are normally associated with that
office. All Officers shall be, and shall be deemed to be, officers and employees of the Company. An Officer may also perform one or more roles as an officer of the Manager. Any Officer may be removed at any time, with or without cause, by the
Manager.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Manager shall have the power and authority to effectuate the sale,
lease, transfer, exchange or other disposition of any, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (including the exercise or grant of any conversion, option, privilege or subscription right or any other right available in connection with
any assets at any time held by the Company) or the merger, consolidation, conversion, division, reorganization or other combination of the Company with or into another entity, for the avoidance of doubt, without the prior consent of any Member or
any other Person being required.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither the Manager nor any Officer authorized
by the Manager shall have the authority, on behalf of the Company, either directly or indirectly, without the prior approval of the Manager and the holders of a majority of the Common Units then outstanding (excluding all Common Units held by PubCo
Members), to take any action that would result in the failure of the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company that is a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of the Effective Date) to be taxable as a partnership
(or, with respect to any such Subsidiary, as a partnership or disregarded entity) for purposes of U.S. federal income tax (or take any action that would have a similar effect), or take any position inconsistent with treating the Company as a
partnership (or any such Subsidiary as a partnership or disregarded entity) for purposes of U.S. federal income tax, except as required by Law.

Section 6.02.
Actions of the Manager
. The Manager may act through any Officer or through any other Person or Persons to whom
authority and duties have been delegated pursuant to
Section
6.07
.



34



Section 6.03.
Resignation; No Removal
. The Manager may resign at any time by
giving written notice to the Members;
provided
,
however
, that any such resignation shall be subject to the appointment of a new manager in accordance with
Section
6.04
. Unless otherwise specified in the
notice, the resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Members (subject to the appointment of a new manager in accordance with
Section
6.04
), and the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to
make it effective. For the avoidance of doubt, the Members have no right under this Agreement to remove or replace the Manager.

Section 6.04.
Vacancies
. Vacancies in the position of Manager occurring for any reason shall be filled by Manager Sub (or, if
Manager Sub has ceased to exist without any successor or assign, then by PubCo or, if PubCo has ceased to exist without any successor or assign, the holders of a majority in interest of the voting capital stock of PubCo immediately prior to such
cessation). For the avoidance of doubt, the Members (other than Manager Sub or, if Manager Sub has ceased to exist, PubCo) have no right under this Agreement to fill any vacancy in the position of Manager.

Section 6.05.
Transactions Between the Company and the Manager
. The Manager may cause the Company to contract and deal with the
Manager, or any Affiliate of the Manager,
provided,
that such contracts and dealings (other than contracts and dealings between the Company and its Subsidiaries) are on terms comparable to and competitive with those available to the Company
from others dealing at arm’s length or are approved by the Members and otherwise are permitted by the Credit Agreements;
provided
that the foregoing shall in no way limit the Manager’s rights under
Sections 3.02
,

3.04
,
3.05
,
3.10
or
3.11
. The Members hereby approve each of the contracts or agreements between or among the Manager, the Company and their respective Affiliates entered into on or prior to the date of this Agreement
that the Existing Member or the Corporate Board has approved in connection with the Reorganization or the IPO as of the date of this Agreement, including the Tax Receivable Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.

Section 6.06.
Reimbursement for Expenses
. The Manager shall not be compensated for its services as Manager of the Company except
as expressly provided in this Agreement. The Members acknowledge and agree that, upon consummation of the IPO, PubCo’s Class A Common Stock will be publicly traded and, therefore, the Manager, through PubCo, will have access to the public
capital markets and that such status and the services performed by the Manager will inure to the benefit of the Company and all Members; therefore, the Manager shall be reimbursed by the Company for any reasonable
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Manager or PubCo on behalf of the Company, including all fees, expenses and costs associated with the Reorganization, the IPO and the transactions related thereto, any
Secondary Offering or Private Sale, of being a public company (including public reporting obligations, proxy statements, stockholder meetings, stock repurchase excise taxes, Stock Exchange (or such other principal United States securities exchange
on which the Class A Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading) fees, transfer agent fees, legal fees, SEC and FINRA filing fees and offering expenses), and maintaining its corporate existence. The Members further acknowledge and agree that
the services performed by the Management Holdings Partners, as Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, will inure to the benefit of the Company and all Members; therefore, Management Holdings shall be reimbursed for any reasonable
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Management Holdings on behalf of the Company or in connection with holding its Common Units in the Company, including maintaining its
corporate existence. In the event that (x) shares of Class A Common Stock are sold to underwriters in the IPO (or in any Secondary Offering) at a price per share that is lower than the price per share for which such shares of Class A
Common Stock are sold to the public in the IPO (or in such Secondary Offering, as applicable) after taking into account underwriters’ discounts or



35



commissions and brokers’ fees or commissions (such difference, the “
Underwriters Discount
”) or (y) shares of Class A Common Stock are sold in a Private
Sale and the aggregate proceeds therefrom are reduced by the amount of brokers’ or placement agents’ fees or commissions (such difference, the “
Placement Agent Discount

of the Company), such amounts shall be treated as “guaranteed payments” within the meaning of Code Section 707(c) and shall not be treated as distributions for purposes of computing the Members’ Capital Accounts (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the income from such guaranteed payments shall not be included for purposes of determining the recipient’s entitlement to Tax Distributions under this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not bear

the Manager in its capacity as the sole managing member of the Company pursuant to authority granted to the Manager by this Agreement;
provided, however,
that, except as otherwise provided herein, such limitation of liability shall not apply

not be responsible for any



36



misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent (so long as such agent was selected in good faith and with reasonable care). The Manager shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of legal
counsel, independent public accountants and other experts, including financial advisors, and any act of or failure to act by the Manager in good faith reliance on such advice shall in no event subject the Manager to liability to the Company or any
Member that is not the Manager.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or in any agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions of Law or equity or otherwise, whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein provides that the Manager shall act in a manner which is, or provide terms
which are, “fair and reasonable” to the Company or any Member that is not the Manager, the Manager shall determine such appropriate action or provide such terms considering, in each case, the relative interests of each party to such
agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or accepted industry practices, and any applicable United States generally accepted accounting practices or principles.

and shall have no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting the Company, other Members or any other Person.

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or in any agreement
contemplated herein or applicable provisions of Law or equity or duty otherwise, whenever in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein the Manager is permitted or required to take any action or to make a decision in its “good
faith” or under another express standard, the Manager shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards imposed by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein, and, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, so long as the Manager acts in good faith or in accordance with such other express standard, the resolution, action or terms so made, taken or provided by the Manager shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement or impose liability upon the Manager or any of the Manager’s Affiliates and shall be deemed approved by all Members.

Section 18-1101(c)
of the Delaware Act, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or in any agreement contemplated herein or

fiduciary or trustee of the Manager) has duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, to the Members, to any Person who acquires an interest in a Unit or to any other Person bound by this Agreement, all such duties (including fiduciary
duties) are hereby eliminated, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and replaced with the duties or standards expressly set forth herein, if any;
provided
,
however
, that the foregoing shall not eliminate the implied contractual
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS AND MANAGER

Section 7.01.
Limitation of Liability and Duties of Members
.

(a) Except as provided in this Agreement or in the Delaware Act, the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company, whether arising in
contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company and no Member or Manager shall be obligated personally for any such debts, obligations, contracts or liabilities of the Company solely by reason of
being a Member or the Manager (except to the extent and under the circumstances set forth in any
non-waivable
provision of the Delaware Act). Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the failure of the Company to observe any formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its business and affairs under this Agreement or the Delaware Act shall not be
grounds for imposing personal liability on the Members for liabilities of the Company.

(b) In accordance with the Delaware Act and the
laws of the State of Delaware, a Member may, under certain circumstances, be required to return amounts previously distributed to such Member. It is the intent of the Members that no Distribution to any Member pursuant to
Articles IV
or

Article XIV
shall be deemed a return of money or other property paid or distributed in violation of the Delaware Act. The payment of any such money or Distribution of any such property to a Member shall be deemed to be a compromise within the
meaning of
Section 18-502(b)
of the Delaware Act, and, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any Member receiving any such money or property shall not be required to return any such money or property to
the Company or any other Person, unless such distribution was made by the Company to its Members in clerical error. However, if any court of competent jurisdiction holds that, notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, any Member is obligated
to make any such payment, such obligation shall be the obligation of such Member and not of any other Member.

(c) To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, including
Section 18-1101(c)
of the Delaware Act, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (but subject to, and without limitation of,

Section
6.08
, which shall control with respect to the Manager) or in any agreement contemplated herein or applicable provisions of Law or equity or otherwise, the parties hereto hereby agree that to the extent that any
Member (or any Member’s Affiliate or any manager, managing member, general partner, director, officer, employee, agent, fiduciary or trustee of any Member or of any Affiliate of a Member) has duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company,



38



to the Manager, to another Member, to any Person who acquires an interest in a Unit or to any other Person bound by this Agreement, all such duties (including fiduciary duties) are hereby
eliminated, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and replaced with the duties or standards expressly set forth herein, if any;
provided
,
however
, that the foregoing shall not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith
and fair dealing. The elimination of duties (including fiduciary duties) to the Company, the Manager, each of the Members, each other Person who acquires an interest in a Unit and each other Person bound by this Agreement and replacement thereof
with the duties or standards expressly set forth herein, if any, are approved by the Company, the Manager, each of the Members, each other Person who acquires an interest in a Unit and each other Person bound by this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, PubCo acknowledges that it will take action, as applicable, through the Corporate Board and its officers, that the members of the Corporate Board and its officers owe fiduciary duties to the stockholders of PubCo and that the foregoing shall
not be deemed to eliminate any such fiduciary duties owed to any Persons in their capacity as a stockholder of PubCo, for so long and to the extent applicable.

Section 7.02.
Lack of Authority
. No Member, other than the Manager or, if applicable, a duly appointed Officer or other Person
delegated authority pursuant to

on the Company or to make any expenditure on behalf of the Company. The Members hereby consent to the exercise by the Manager of the powers conferred on them by Law and this Agreement.

Section 7.03.
No Right of Partition
. No Member, other than the Manager, shall have the right to seek or obtain partition by court
decree or operation of Law of any property of the Company, or the right to own or use particular or individual assets of the Company.

5.06

“
Indemnified Person

case of any such amendment, substitution or replacement only to the extent that such amendment, substitution or replacement permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than the Company is providing immediately prior to such
amendment), against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Person (or one or more of such Person’s Affiliates) by reason of
the fact that such Person is or was a Member or an Affiliate thereof (other than as a result of an ownership interest in PubCo) or is or was serving as the Manager or a manager, director, officer, employee or other agent of the Manager, or a
director, manager, Officer, employee or other agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a manager, officer, director, principal, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited

Affiliates’ willful misconduct or knowing violation of Law or for any present or future breaches (or, in the case of the Manager or its Affiliates, material breaches) of any representations, warranties or covenants by such Indemnified Person
or its Affiliates contained herein or in Other Agreements with the

timely pay its taxes and (y) are not attributable to such Person under
Section
5.06
, and then only to the extent such taxes would otherwise be indemnified under this
Section
7.04(a)
.
Reasonable expenses, including
out-of-pocket
attorneys’ fees, incurred by any such Indemnified Person in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Company in
advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Person is
not entitled to be indemnified by the Company.

(b) The right to indemnification and the advancement of expenses conferred in this

Section
7.04
shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, agreement, bylaw, action by the Manager or otherwise.

(c) The Company shall maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, or substantially equivalent insurance, at its expense,
to protect any Indemnified Person against any expense, liability or loss described in
Section
7.04(a)

loss under the provisions of this
Section
7.04

customary for companies of similar size engaged in similar lines of business, as determined in good faith by the Manager, and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to purchase (or cause to be purchased) directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance (including employment practices coverage) with a carrier and in an amount determined necessary or desirable as determined in good faith by the Manager.

(d) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided for in this
Section
7.04
shall be provided out of and to
the extent of Company assets only. No Member (unless such Member otherwise agrees in writing or is found in a
non-appealable
decision by a court of competent jurisdiction to have personal liability on account
thereof) shall have personal liability on account thereof or shall be required to make additional Capital Contributions to help satisfy such indemnity of the Company. The Company (i) shall be the primary indemnitor of first resort for such
Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Section
7.04
and (ii) shall be fully responsible for the advancement of all expenses and the payment of all damages or liabilities with respect to such Indemnified Person which are
addressed by this
Section
7.04
.

(e) If this
Section
7.04
or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Section
7.04

any applicable portion of this
Section
7.04
that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

. Any Member who shall Transfer any Unit in a manner in accordance with this Agreement shall cease to be a Member with respect to such Units and shall no longer have any rights or privileges, or, except as set forth in this

Section
10.06
, duties, liabilities or obligations, of a Member with respect to such Units or other interest (it being understood, however, that the applicable provisions of
Sections 6.08
and
7.04
shall
continue to inure to such Person’s benefit and
Sections 5.06
and
9.04
shall continue to bind such Person), except that unless and until the Assignee (if not already a Member) is admitted as a Substituted Member in accordance with
the provisions of
Article XII
(the “
Admission Date
”)
,
(i) such Transferring Member shall retain all of the duties, liabilities and obligations of a Member with respect to such Units, and
(ii) the Manager may, in its sole discretion, reinstate all or any portion of the rights and privileges of such Member with respect to such Units for any period of time prior to the Admission Date. Nothing contained herein shall relieve any

Units in the Company from any liability of such Member to the Company with respect to such Units that may exist as of the Admission Date or that is otherwise specified in the Delaware Act or for
any liability to the Company or any other Person for any materially false statement made by such Member (in its capacity as such) or for any present or future breaches of any representations, warranties or covenants by such Member (in its capacity
as such) contained herein or in the Other Agreements with the Company.

Section 10.07.
Overriding Provisions
.

(a) Any Transfer or attempted Transfer of any Units in violation of this Agreement (including any prohibited indirect Transfers) shall be, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, null and void
ab initio,
and the provisions of
Sections 10.05
and
10.06
shall not apply to any such Transfers. For the avoidance of doubt, any Person to whom a Transfer is made or
attempted in violation of this Agreement shall not become a Member and shall not have any other rights in or with respect to any rights of a Member of the Company with respect to the applicable Units. The approval of any Transfer in any one or more
instances shall not limit or waive the requirement for such approval in any other or future instance. The Manager shall promptly amend the Schedule of Members to reflect any Permitted Transfer pursuant to this
Article X
;
provided
, that
any Permitted Transferee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer of the type set forth in
Section
10.02(ii)(B)
that is redeemed or exchanged pursuant to
Article XI
substantially concurrently with the consummation of such
Permitted Transfer shall be deemed to be set forth on the Schedule of Members until such time as such Redemption or Direct Exchange is consummated, with no further action required by the Manager (provided that the Manager shall amend the Schedule of
Members following the consummation of such Redemption or Direct Exchange to reflect the occurrence thereof);
provided
,
further
, that if such Redemption or Direct Exchange is not consummated reasonably promptly following such Permitted
Transfer, then the Manager shall promptly amend the Schedule of Members to either reflect such Permitted Transferee or any subsequent Permitted Transfer by such Permitted Transferee, as described in
Section
10.02(ii)(B)
, as
applicable, in order to maintain a definitive record of ownership of the Units in accordance with
Section
3.01(b)
.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of

Section
10.01
,
Section
10.02
,
Article XI
and
Article XII)
, in no event shall any Member Transfer any Units to the extent such Transfer would:

(i) result in the violation of the Securities Act, or any other applicable federal, state or foreign Laws;

(ii) cause an assignment under the Investment Company Act;

(iii) in the reasonable determination of the Manager, be a violation of or a default (or an event that, with notice or the lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under, or result in an acceleration of any obligation under any Credit Agreement to which PubCo, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party;
provided
that the payee or creditor to whom PubCo, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries owes such obligation is not an Affiliate of thereof;

(iv) be a Transfer to a Person who is not legally
competent or who has not achieved his or her majority of age under applicable Law (excluding trusts or similar arrangements established for the benefit of minors or other permitted transfers to minors under the Management Holdings Agreement);



46



(v) cause the Company to be (or create a material risk of the Company being) treated as a
“publicly traded partnership” or taxed as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704 of the Code or any successor provision thereto under the Code, in each case as determined in good faith by the Manager; or

(vi) unless approved by the Manager, result in the Company having more than one hundred (100) partners, within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)
(determined by taking into account Treasury Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)).


(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall any Member that is not a “United States person”
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code Transfer any Units, unless such Member and the transferee have delivered to the Company, in respect of the relevant Transfer, written evidence that all required withholding under
Section 1446(f) of the Code has been done and duly remitted to the applicable taxing authority or duly executed certifications (prepared in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations or other authorities) of an exemption from such
withholding;
provided
, that the Company shall reasonably cooperate with any reasonable requests from such Member for certifications or other information from the Company in connection with satisfying this

Section
10.07(c)
prior to the relevant Transfer (or Redemption or Direct Exchange, as applicable).

Section 10.08.
Spousal Consent
. In connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any Member who is a natural
person will deliver to the Company an executed consent from such Member’s spouse (if any) in the form of
Exhibit
B-1
attached hereto or a Member’s spouse confirmation of separate property in
the form of
Exhibit
B-2
attached hereto. If, at any time subsequent to the date of this Agreement such Member becomes legally married (whether in the first instance or to a different spouse), such
Member shall cause his or her spouse to execute and deliver to the Company a consent in the form of
Exhibit
B-1
or
Exhibit
B-2
attached hereto. Such
Member’s
non-delivery
to the Company of an executed consent in the form of
Exhibit
B-1
or
Exhibit
B-2
at any
time shall constitute such Member’s continuing representation and warranty that such Member is not legally married as of such date.

Section 10.09.
Certain Transactions with respect to PubCo
.

(a) In connection with a Change of Control Transaction, the Manager shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require each
Non-PubCo
Member to effect a Redemption of all or a portion of such Member’s Vested Units and Unvested Units that accelerate pursuant to the terms of the Restricted Unit Award Agreement in connection with such
Change of Control Transaction, together with the cancellation of an equal number of shares of Class B Common Stock, pursuant to which such Units will be exchanged for shares of Class A Common Stock (or economically equivalent cash or
securities of a successor entity),
mutatis mutandis,
in accordance with the Redemption provisions of
Article XI
(applied for this purpose as if PubCo had delivered an Election Notice that specified a Share Settlement with respect to
such Redemption) and otherwise in accordance with this
Section
10.09(a)
. Any such Redemption pursuant to this
Section
10.09(a)
shall be effective immediately prior to the consummation of such
Change of Control Transaction



47



(and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be contingent upon the consummation of such Change of Control Transaction and shall not be effective if such Change of Control Transaction is not
consummated) (the date of such Redemption pursuant to this
Section
10.09(a)
, the “
Change of Control Date
”)
.
From and after the Change of Control Date, (i) the Vested Units, accelerated
Unvested Units and any shares of Class B Common Stock subject to such Redemption shall be deemed to be transferred to PubCo on the Change of Control Date and (ii) each such Member shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Units
and shares of Class B Common Stock subject to such Redemption (other than the right to receive shares of Class A Common Stock (or economically equivalent cash or equity securities in a successor entity) pursuant to such Redemption, and,
for the avoidance of doubt, any rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement). In the event the Manager desires to initiate the provisions of this
Section
10.09
, the Manager shall provide written notice of an expected Change
of Control Transaction to all Members within the earlier of (x) five (5) Business Days following the execution of an agreement with respect to such Change of Control Transaction and (y) ten (10) Business Days before the proposed date upon
which the contemplated Change of Control Transaction is to be effected, including in such notice such information as may reasonably describe the Change of Control Transaction, subject to Law, including the date of execution of such agreement or such
proposed effective date, as applicable, the amount and types of consideration to be paid for shares of Class A Common Stock in the Change of Control Transaction and any election with respect to types of consideration that a holder of shares of
Class A Common Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to make in connection with a Change of Control Transaction (which election shall be available to each Member on the same terms as holders of shares of Class A Common Stock). Following
delivery of such notice and on or prior to the Change of Control Date, the Members shall take all actions reasonably requested by PubCo to effect such Redemption in accordance with the terms of
Article XI
, including taking any action and
delivering any document required pursuant to this
Section
10.09(a)
to effect such Redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Manager requires the Members to exchange less than all of their outstanding Units
(and to surrender a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock for cancellation), each Member’s participation in the Change of Control Transaction shall be reduced
pro

rata.


(b) In the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over bid, recapitalization, or similar transaction with respect to
Class A Common Stock (a “
PubCo Offer
”)
is proposed by PubCo or is proposed to PubCo or its stockholders and approved by the Corporate Board or is otherwise effected or to be effected with the consent
or approval of the Corporate Board, the Manager shall provide written notice of the PubCo Offer to all
Non-PubCo
Members within the earlier of (i) five (5) Business Days following the execution of an
agreement (if applicable) with respect to, or the commencement of (if applicable), such PubCo Offer and (ii) ten (10) Business Days before the proposed date upon which the PubCo Offer is to be effected, including in such notice such information
as may reasonably describe the PubCo Offer, subject to Law, including the date of execution of such agreement (if applicable) or of such commencement (if applicable), the material terms of such PubCo Offer, including the amount and types of
consideration to be received by holders of shares of Class A Common Stock in the PubCo Offer, any election with respect to types of consideration that a holder of shares of Class A Common Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled to make in
connection with such PubCo Offer, and the number of Units (and the corresponding shares of Class B Common Stock) held by such Member that is applicable to such PubCo Offer. The
Non-PubCo
Members shall be
permitted to participate in such PubCo Offer in respect of such Member’s Vested Units by delivering a written notice of



48



participation that is effective immediately prior to the consummation of such PubCo Offer (and that is contingent upon consummation of such offer), and shall include such information necessary
for consummation of such offer as requested by PubCo. In the case of any PubCo Offer that was initially proposed by PubCo, PubCo shall use reasonable best efforts to enable and permit the
Non-PubCo
Members to
participate in such transaction in respect of such Member’s Vested Units to the same extent or on an economically equivalent basis as the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock, and to enable such Members to participate in such
transaction without being required to exchange Vested Units or shares of Class B Common Stock prior to the consummation of such transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Common Unitholders be entitled to receive in such PubCo
Offer aggregate consideration for each Common Unit that is greater than the consideration payable in respect of each share of Class A Common Stock in connection with a PubCo Offer (it being understood that payments under or in respect of the
Tax Receivable Agreement shall not be considered part of any such consideration).

(c) In the event that a transaction or proposed
transaction constitutes both a Change of Control Transaction and a PubCo Offer, the provisions of
Section
10.09(a)
shall take precedence over the provisions of
Section
10.09(b)
with respect to such
transaction, and the provisions of
Section
10.09(b)
shall be subordinate to provisions of
Section
10.09(a)
, and may only be triggered if the Manager elects to waive the provisions of

Section
10.09(a)
.

ARTICLE XI

REDEMPTION AND DIRECT EXCHANGE RIGHTS

Section 11.01.
Redemption Right of a Member
.

(a) Subject to
Section
11.01(b)
and
Section
11.08
, each

Non-PubCo
Member shall be entitled to cause the Company to redeem (a “
Redemption
”)
all or any portion of its Common Units (excluding any Common Units that are
Unvested Units or are subject to Transfer limitations indirectly pursuant to a Restricted Unit Award Agreement applicable to the Corresponding Management Units, unless otherwise determined by the Manager (which determination, prior to the Management
Elective Redemption Date, shall require the consent of the AS Representative)) (such Common Units, the “
Eligible Units
”, and such right, the “
Redemption Right
”) (i) with respect to a Permitted
Redemption, at any time and from time to time following the waiver or expiration of any contractual
lock-up
period relating to the shares of PubCo that may be applicable to such Member and (ii) in any
other case, during the Quarterly Redemption Notice Period preceding the desired Redemption Date;
provided
that, with respect to any Redemption other than a Management
Co-Redemption,
a Member (or a
Management Holdings Partner on whose behalf Management Holdings is effecting a Redemption of Eligible Units) shall be required to redeem at least the Minimum Redemption Threshold. A Member desiring to exercise its Redemption Right (each, a
“
Redeeming Member
”)
shall exercise such right by giving written notice (the “
Redemption Notice
”)
to the Company with a copy to PubCo. The Redemption Notice
shall specify the number of Eligible Units (the “
Redeemed Units
”)
that the Redeeming Member intends to have the Company redeem and the applicable Redemption Date
;
provided,

that the Company, PubCo and the Redeeming Member may change the number of Redeemed Units and/or the Redemption Date specified in such Redemption Notice to another number and/or date by mutual agreement signed in writing by each of them;

provided, further
that in the event PubCo elects a



49



Share Settlement in connection with a Permitted Redemption, the Permitted Redemption may be conditioned (including as to timing) by the Redeeming Member on the closing of a purchase by another
Person (whether in an underwritten offering, tender or exchange offer, or otherwise) of the shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued in connection with such proposed Permitted Redemption. Subject to

Section
11.03
and unless the Redeeming Member timely has delivered a Retraction Notice as provided in
Section
11.01(d)
or has revoked or delayed a Redemption as provided in

Section
11.01(e)
, on the Redemption Date (to be effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date):

(i) the Redeeming Member shall Transfer and surrender, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (x) the Redeemed Units to the Company
(including any certificates representing the Redeemed Units if they are certificated), and (y) a number of shares of Class B Common Stock (together with any Corresponding Rights) equal to the number of Redeemed Units to PubCo;

(ii) the Company shall (w) cancel the Redeemed Units, (x) transfer to the Redeeming Member the consideration to which the Redeeming
Member is entitled under
Section
11.01(c)
(and equal to the Capital Contribution with respect thereto received from PubCo pursuant to
Section
11.02)
, (y) if the Units are certificated, issue to the
Redeeming Member a certificate for a number of Common Units equal to the difference (if any) between the number of Common Units evidenced by the certificate surrendered by the Redeeming Member pursuant to

Section
11.01(a)(i)(x)
above and the Redeemed Units and (z) issue to PubCo a number of Common Units equal to the number of Redeemed Units surrendered by the Redeeming Member in accordance with

Section
11.02
; and

(iii) PubCo shall cancel and retire for no consideration the shares of Class B Common
Stock (together with any Corresponding Rights) that were Transferred to PubCo pursuant to
Section
11.01(a)(i)(y)
above.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
ARTICLE XI
, during the period from the Effective Date until the Management Elective
Redemption Date, (i) if at any time (subject to any limitations in this Agreement and applicable Law) one or more AS Aggregators elect to exercise a Redemption Right (an “
AS Redemption
”), Management Holdings shall
transfer, in a Redemption or Direct Exchange (as applicable), a percentage of its Eligible Units that corresponds to the percentage of the AS Aggregators’ Eligible Units (relative to the AS Aggregators’ total aggregate Eligible Units
held) in respect of which a Redemption Right is being exercised (such percentage, the “
AS Sale Percentage
”), and (ii) Management Holdings shall not be permitted to exercise its Redemption Right pursuant to

Section
11.01(a)
independently of an AS Redemption (any such mandatory Redemption event, a “
Management
Co-Redemption
”). In furtherance of the foregoing, if a
redeeming AS Aggregator delivers a Redemption Notice, Management Holdings shall be deemed to have delivered a Redemption Notice for purposes of a simultaneous Management
Co-Redemption,
with the number of
Redeemed Units with respect thereto to be calculated based on the AS Sale Percentage. A Management
Co-Redemption
shall be effectuated at the same time and on the same terms (including by means of a Direct
Exchange, if elected by Pubco pursuant to
Section
11.03(a)
) as the corresponding AS Redemption. If a redeeming AS Aggregator retracts, revokes or delays its Redemption or Direct Exchange, as applicable, a corresponding
action shall be deemed to be taken with respect to the Management
Co-Redemption,




50



so that in all instances, until the Management Elective Redemption Date, a Management
Co-Redemption
shall occur or not occur together with the AS
Redemption giving rise to such Management
Co-Redemption.
In connection with any Management
Co-Redemption,
Management Holdings agrees to take such actions and provide
such cooperation (including as to the calculation of Redeemed Units, if applicable) as may be reasonably requested by the Company or PubCo in connection with consummating such Management
Co-Redemption.
For the
avoidance of doubt, the terms of
Sections 11.01(d)
, (
e
) and (
i
) pertaining to Management Holdings Partners shall not apply in the case of a Management
Co-Redemption.


(c) PubCo shall have the option (as determined by the Corporate Board), as provided in
Section
11.02
, to elect to
have the Redeemed Units be redeemed in consideration for either a Share Settlement or a Cash Settlement;
provided,
for the avoidance of doubt, that PubCo may elect to have the Redeemed Units be redeemed in consideration for a Cash Settlement
only to the extent that PubCo has funds available from a Secondary Offering in an amount at least equal to the Redeemed Units Equivalent. PubCo shall give written notice (the “
Election Notice
”)
to the
Company (with a copy to the applicable Redeeming Member) of such election within three (3) Business Days of receiving the Redemption Notice;
provided,
that if PubCo does not timely deliver an Election Notice, PubCo shall be deemed to
have elected the Share Settlement method. If PubCo elects a Share Settlement (including in connection with a Direct Exchange pursuant to
Section
11.03
), PubCo shall deliver or cause to be delivered the number of shares of
Class A Common Stock deliverable upon such Share Settlement as promptly as practicable (but not later than three (3) Business Days) after the Redemption Date, at the offices of the then-acting registrar and transfer agent of the shares of
Class A Common Stock (or, if there is no then-acting registrar and transfer agent of Class A Common Stock, at the principal executive offices of PubCo), registered in the name of the relevant Redeeming Member (or in such other name(s) as
is requested in writing by the Redeeming Member), in certificated or uncertificated form, as determined by PubCo;
provided,
that to the extent the shares of Class A Common Stock are settled through the facilities of The Depository Trust
Company, upon the written instruction of the Redeeming Member set forth in the Redemption Notice, PubCo shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the shares of Class A Common Stock deliverable to such Redeeming Member through the
facilities of The Depository Trust Company, to the account of the participant(s) of The Depository Trust Company designated by such Redeeming Member by no later than the close of business on the Business Day immediately following the Redemption
Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither PubCo nor the Company shall effectuate a Cash Settlement that is to be funded by a Secondary Offering unless PubCo has authorized and consummated such Secondary Offering by no
later than the Redemption Date for the purpose of satisfying such Cash Settlement. If for any reason PubCo is unable to complete such Secondary Offering by the Redemption Date, then the applicable Redeemed Units shall instead be redeemed by Share
Settlement, notwithstanding that PubCo may have initially elected a Cash Settlement of such Redeemed Units.



51



(d) Unless otherwise agreed by the Redeeming Member, in the event PubCo elects the Cash
Settlement in connection with any Permitted Redemption, the Redeeming Member may retract its Redemption Notice by giving written notice (the “
Retraction Notice
”)
to the Company (with a copy to PubCo)
within two (2) Business Days of delivery of the Election Notice. Subject to the last three sentences of this
Section
11.01(d)
, if, in the case of a Redemption that is not a Permitted Redemption, the Common Unit
Redemption Price (calculated for purposes of this
Section
11.01(d)
as set forth in
clause (ii)
of such definition) (determined by treating the last full Trading Day that is three (3) Business Days
immediately prior to the applicable Redemption Date as the final measurement date of the
five-day
period used to calculate the Common Unit Redemption Price) decreases by more than 10% from the Common Unit
Redemption Price (determined by treating the last full Trading Day that is immediately prior to the date of delivery of the applicable Redemption Notice as the final measurement date of such
five-day
period
used to calculate the Common Unit Redemption Price), the Redeeming Member may (unless otherwise agreed by the Redeeming Member) elect to retract its Redemption Notice by giving written notice of such election (a “
Restricted Retraction
Notice
”) to PubCo and the Company no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Redemption Date. The timely delivery of a Retraction Notice or Restricted Retraction Notice, as applicable, shall terminate all of the Redeeming
Member’s, the Company’s and PubCo’s rights and obligations under this
Section
11.01
arising from the applicable Redemption Notice (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, from any Redemption Notice not
retracted or that may be delivered in the future). A Redeeming Member may deliver a Restricted Retraction Notice only once in every
12-month
period (and any additional Restricted Retraction Notice delivered by
such Redeeming Member within such
12-month
period shall be deemed null and void
ab initio
and ineffective with respect to the revocation of the Redemption specified therein). A Redeeming Member who
revokes a Redemption pursuant to a Restricted Retraction Notice may not participate in the Redemption to occur on the next Quarterly Redemption Date immediately following the Quarterly Redemption Date with respect to which the Restricted Retraction
Notice pertains. In the event that Management Holdings is the Redeeming Member, (a) any retraction that is permitted under this
Section
11.01(d)
may be made or not made separately as to Redeemed Units that correspond
to Corresponding Management Units held by different Management Holdings Partners that have requested a Redemption pursuant to the terms of the Management Holdings Agreement, in which case the provisions of this
Section
11.01(d)

shall be applied to reflect such partial retraction,
mutatis mutandis
, and (b) the limitations set forth in the preceding two sentences shall apply to the Management Holdings Partner in relation to whom a Redemption Notice or
Restricted Retraction Notice has been delivered by Management Holdings, and not to Management Holdings itself.

(e) In the event PubCo
elects a Share Settlement in connection with a Redemption, a Redeeming Member shall be entitled (unless otherwise agreed by the Redeeming Member) to revoke its Redemption Notice or delay the consummation of a Redemption (or, in the case of
Management Holdings, revoke that portion of the Redemption Notice or delay that portion of the Redemption corresponding to the Corresponding Management Units held by any particular requesting Management Holdings Partner pursuant to the terms of the
Management Holdings Agreement) if any of the following conditions exists:

(i) any registration statement pursuant to which the resale of
the Class A Common Stock to be registered for such Redeeming Member (or corresponding Management Holdings Partner) at or immediately following the consummation of the Redemption shall have ceased to be effective pursuant to any action or
inaction by the SEC or no such resale registration statement has yet become effective;



52



(ii) PubCo shall have failed to cause any related prospectus to be supplemented by any
required prospectus supplement necessary to effect such Redemption;

(iii) PubCo shall have exercised its right to defer, delay or suspend
the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement and such deferral, delay or suspension shall affect the ability of such Redeeming Member (or corresponding Management Holdings Partner) to have its Class A Common Stock registered at or
immediately following the consummation of the Redemption;

(iv) the Redeeming Member (or corresponding Management Holdings Partner) is in
possession of any material
non-public
information concerning PubCo, the receipt of which results in such Redeeming Member (or corresponding Management Holdings Partner) being prohibited or restricted from
selling Class A Common Stock at or immediately following the Redemption without disclosure of such information (and PubCo does not permit disclosure of such information);

(v) any stop order relating to the registration statement pursuant to which the Class A Common Stock was to be registered by such
Redeeming Member (or corresponding Management Holdings Partner) at or immediately following the Redemption shall have been issued by the SEC;

(vi) there shall have occurred a material disruption in the securities markets generally or in the market or markets in which the Class A
Common Stock is then traded;

(vii) there shall be in effect an injunction, a restraining order or a decree of any nature of any
Governmental Entity that restrains or prohibits the Redemption;

(viii) PubCo shall have failed to comply in all material respects with its
obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, and such failure shall have affected the ability of such Redeeming Member (or corresponding Management Holdings Partner), if applicable, to consummate the resale of Class A Common Stock to be
received upon such Redemption pursuant to an effective registration statement; or

(ix) the Redemption Date would occur three
(3) Business Days or less prior to, or during, a Redemption
Black-Out
Period.

If a Redeeming
Member delays the consummation of a Redemption pursuant to this
Section
11.01(e)
, the Redemption Date shall occur on the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the condition(s) giving rise to such delay cease
to exist (or such earlier date as PubCo, the Company and such Redeeming Member may agree in writing).

(f) The number of shares of
Class A Common Stock (or Redeemed Units Equivalent, if applicable) (together with any Corresponding Rights) applicable to any Share Settlement or Cash Settlement shall not be adjusted on account of any Distributions previously made with respect
to the Redeemed Units or dividends previously paid with respect to Class A Common Stock;
provided, however,
that if a Redeeming Member causes the Company to redeem Redeemed Units and the Redemption Date occurs subsequent to the record
date for any Distribution with respect to the Redeemed Units but prior to payment of such Distribution, the Redeeming Member shall be entitled to receive such Distribution with respect to the Redeemed Units on the date that it is made
notwithstanding that the Redeeming Member Transferred and surrendered the Redeemed Units to the Company prior to such date.



53



(g) In the case of a Share Settlement, in the event a reclassification or other similar
transaction occurs following delivery of a Redemption Notice, but prior to the Redemption Date, as a result of which shares of Class A Common Stock are converted into another security, then a Redeeming Member shall be entitled to receive the
amount of such other security (and, if applicable, any Corresponding Rights) that the Redeeming Member would have received if such Redemption Right had been exercised and the Redemption Date had occurred immediately prior to the record date of such
reclassification or other similar transaction.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) no Redemption shall be
permitted (and, if attempted, shall be void
ab initio
) if, in the good faith determination of the Company or of PubCo, such Redemption would have the effect set forth in
Section
10.07(b)(v)
and
(vi)
, or
otherwise pose a material risk that the Company would be a “publicly traded partnership” under Section 7704 of the Code, and (ii) if there is a material risk that the Company would be a “publicly traded partnership”
under Section 7704 of the Code notwithstanding the restrictions then in effect with respect to any Redemptions, the Company or PubCo may impose additional restrictions on Redemptions as the Company or PubCo may determine to be necessary or
advisable so that the Company is not treated as a “publicly traded partnership” under Section 7704 of the Code.

(i) For
the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Member shall not be entitled to redeem Redeemed Units to the extent PubCo determines that such Redemption (i) would be prohibited by Law or regulation (including the
unavailability of any requisite registration statement filed under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) or (ii) would not be permitted under any other agreements with PubCo or its Subsidiaries to which such Member (or corresponding
Management Holdings Partner) may be party or any written policies of PubCo related to unlawful or improper trading (including the policies of PubCo relating to insider trading).

Section 11.02.
Election and Contribution of PubCo
. Unless the Redeeming Member has timely delivered a Retraction Notice or
Restricted Retraction Notice as provided in
Section
11.01(d)
, or has revoked or delayed a Redemption as provided in
Section
11.01(e)
, subject to
Section
11.03
, on the
Redemption Date (to be effective immediately prior to the close of business on the Redemption Date) (i) PubCo shall make a Capital Contribution to the Company (in the form of the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement, as determined by PubCo
in accordance with
Section
11.01(c)
), and (ii) except in connection with a Direct Exchange pursuant to
Section
11.03
, the Company shall issue to PubCo a number of Common Units equal to the
number of Redeemed Units surrendered by the Redeeming Member. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
Section
11.01(c)
and
Section
11.03
, in the event
that PubCo elects a Cash Settlement, PubCo shall only be obligated to contribute to the Company an amount in respect of such Cash Settlement equal to the Redeemed Units Equivalent with respect to such Cash Settlement, which in no event shall exceed
the amount actually paid by the Company to the Redeeming Member as the Cash Settlement. The timely delivery of a Retraction Notice or Restricted Retraction Notice shall terminate all of the Company’s and PubCo’s rights and obligations
under this
Section
11.02
arising from the Redemption Notice.

Section 11.03.
Direct Exchange Right of PubCo
.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article XI
(save for the limitations set forth in

Section
11.01(c)
regarding PubCo’s option to select the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement and the timing for such election, and without limitation to the rights of the

Non-PubCo
Members under
Section
11.01
, including the right to revoke a Redemption Notice or otherwise delay the consummation of a Redemption, unless otherwise agreed by a Redeeming
Member), PubCo may, in its sole and absolute discretion (as determined by the Corporate Board) (subject to the limitations on such discretion set forth in
Section
11.01(c)
), elect to effect on the Redemption Date the
exchange of Redeemed Units for the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement, as the case may be, through a direct exchange of such Redeemed Units and the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement, as applicable, between the Redeeming Member and PubCo
(a “
Direct Exchange
”)
(rather than contributing the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement, as the case may be, to the Company in accordance with
Section
11.02
for purposes of
the Company redeeming the Redeemed Units from the Redeeming Member in consideration of the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement, as applicable). Upon such Direct Exchange pursuant to this
Section
11.03
, PubCo shall
acquire the Redeemed Units and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of such Units.

(b) PubCo may, at any time
prior to a Redemption Date (including after delivery of an Election Notice pursuant to
Section
11.01(c)
), deliver written notice (an “
Exchange Election Notice
”)
to the Company
and the Redeeming Member setting forth its election to exercise its right to consummate a Direct Exchange;
provided,
that such election is subject to the limitations set forth in
Section
11.01(c)
and does not
unreasonably prejudice the ability of the parties to consummate a Redemption or Direct Exchange on the Redemption Date. An Exchange Election Notice may be revoked by PubCo at any time;
provided,
that any such revocation does not unreasonably
prejudice the ability of the parties to consummate a Redemption or Direct Exchange on the Redemption Date. The right to consummate a Direct Exchange in all events shall be exercisable for all of the Redeemed Units that would have otherwise been
subject to a Redemption.

(c) Except as otherwise provided by this
Section
11.03
, a Direct Exchange shall be
consummated pursuant to the same timeframe as the relevant Redemption would have been consummated if PubCo had not delivered an Exchange Election Notice and as follows:

(i) the Redeeming Member shall transfer and surrender to PubCo, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (x) the Redeemed Units
(including any certificates representing the Redeemed Units if they are certificated, for delivery to the Company in exchange for a new certificate pursuant to
Section
11.03(c)(iii)
) and (y) a number of shares of
Class B Common Stock (together with any Corresponding Rights) equal to the number of Redeemed Units, to the extent applicable;

(ii)
PubCo shall (x) pay to the Redeeming Member the Share Settlement or the Cash Settlement, as applicable, (y) cancel and retire for no consideration the shares of Class B Common Stock (together with any Corresponding Rights) that were
Transferred to PubCo pursuant to
Section
11.03(c)(i)(y)
above, and (z) deliver to the Company any certificates representing the Redeemed Units, if they are certificated, in exchange for a new certificate pursuant to

Section
11.03(c)(iii)
; and



55



(iii) the Company shall (x) register PubCo as the owner of the Redeemed Units and
(y) if the Units are certificated, issue to the Redeeming Member a certificate for a number of Common Units equal to the difference (if any) between the number of Common Units evidenced by the certificate surrendered by the Redeeming Member
pursuant to
Section
11.03(c)(i)(x)
and the Redeemed Units, and issue to PubCo a certificate for the number of Redeemed Units.

Section 11.04.
Reservation of shares of Class
A Common Stock; Listing; Certificate of PubCo
.


(a) At all times PubCo shall reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of
issuance upon a Share Settlement in connection with a Redemption or Direct Exchange, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock as shall be issuable upon any such Share Settlement pursuant to a Redemption or Direct Exchange;
provided

that nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude PubCo from satisfying its obligations in respect of any such Share Settlement pursuant to a Redemption or Direct Exchange by delivery of purchased Class A Common Stock (which may
or may not be held in the treasury of PubCo) or by way of Cash Settlement (subject to the limitations in
Section
11.01(c)
). PubCo shall deliver Class A Common Stock that has been registered under the Securities Act
with respect to any Share Settlement pursuant to a Redemption or Direct Exchange to the extent a registration statement is effective and available with respect to such shares;
provided,
all such unregistered shares of Class A Common
Stock (if any) shall be entitled to the registration rights set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement if the holders thereof are party to the Registration Rights Agreement and have such rights thereunder. PubCo shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to list the Class A Common Stock required to be delivered upon any such Share Settlement pursuant to a Redemption or Direct Exchange prior to such delivery upon each national securities exchange upon which the outstanding
shares of Class A Common Stock are listed at the time of such Share Settlement pursuant to a Redemption or Direct Exchange (it being understood that any such shares may be subject to transfer restrictions under applicable securities Laws).
PubCo covenants that all shares of Class A Common Stock issued in connection with a Share Settlement pursuant to a Redemption or Direct Exchange will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and

non-assessable.
The provisions of this
Article XI
shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with any corresponding provisions of PubCo’s certificate of incorporation (if any).

(b) Prior to any Redemption or Direct Exchange effected pursuant to this Agreement, PubCo shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
to qualify for exemption under Rule
16b-3(d)
or (e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act, and to be exempt for purposes of Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, any acquisitions from, or dispositions
to, PubCo of equity securities of PubCo (including derivative securities with respect thereto) and any securities that may be deemed to be equity securities or derivative securities of PubCo for such purposes that result from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, by each officer or director of PubCo, including any director by deputization. The authorizing resolutions shall be approved by either the Corporate Board or a committee thereof composed solely of two or more
Non-Employee
Directors (as defined in Rule
16b-3)
of PubCo (with the authorizing resolutions specifying the name of each such director or officer whose acquisition or
disposition of securities is to be exempted and the number of securities that may be acquired and disposed of by each such Person pursuant to this Agreement).



56



Section 11.05.
Effect of Exercise of Redemption or Direct Exchange
. This
Agreement shall continue notwithstanding the consummation of a Redemption or Direct Exchange by a Member and all rights set forth herein shall continue in effect with respect to the remaining Members and, to the extent the Redeeming Member has a
remaining Unit following such Redemption or Direct Exchange, the Redeeming Member. No Redemption or Direct Exchange shall relieve a Redeeming Member, the Company or PubCo of any prior breach of this Agreement by such Redeeming Member, the Company or
PubCo.

Section 11.06.
Tax Treatment
.

(a) In connection with any Redemption or Direct Exchange, the Redeeming Member shall to the extent it is legally entitled to deliver such form,
deliver to PubCo or the Company, as applicable, a certificate, dated as of the Redemption Date, in a form reasonably acceptable to PubCo or the Company, as applicable, certifying as to such Redeeming Member’s taxpayer identification number and
that such Redeeming Member is a not a foreign person for purposes of Section 1445 and Section 1446(f) of the Code (which certificate may be an IRS Form
W-9
if then sufficient for such purposes under
applicable Law) (such certificate a “
Non-Foreign
Person Certificate
”). If a Redeeming Member is unable to provide a
Non-Foreign
Person
Certificate in connection with a Redemption or a Direct Exchange, then (i) such Redeeming Member and the Company shall cooperate to provide any other certification or determination described in Treasury Regulations Sections
1.1446(f)-2(b)
and
1.1446(f)-2(c)
or otherwise permitted under applicable Law at the time of such Redemption or Direct Exchange, and PubCo or the Company, as applicable, shall
be permitted to withhold on the amount realized by such Redeeming Member in respect of such Redemption or Direct Exchange to the extent required under in Section 1446(f) of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder after taking into account
the certificate or other determination provided pursuant this sentence and (ii) upon request and to the extent permitted under applicable Law, the Company shall deliver a certificate pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-11T(d)(2)
certifying that fifty percent (50%) or more of the value of the gross assets of the Company does not consist of “U.S. real property interests” (as used in Treasury
Regulations
Section 1.1445-11T),
or that ninety percent (90%) or more of the value of the gross assets of the Company does not consist of “U.S. real property interests” plus “cash or
cash equivalents” (as used in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-11T);

provided
, that if the Company is not legally entitled to provide the certificate described in clause (ii), PubCo shall
be permitted to withhold on the amount realized by such Redeeming Member in respect of such Redemption or Direct Exchange to the extent required under in Section 1445 of the Code and Treasury Regulations.

(b) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that a Redemption or a Direct Exchange, as the case
may be, shall be treated as a direct exchange between PubCo and the Redeeming Member for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes.



57



Section 11.07.
Company Exchange and Redemption Right
. At the discretion of
PubCo, and provided that the Class A Common Stock is listed or admitted to trading on the Stock Exchange, the Common Units may be subject to mandatory Redemption in each of the following circumstances:

(a) if PubCo or the Company has obtained the consent of each of (i) the holders of a majority of the Common Units then outstanding
(excluding all Common Units held by PubCo Members) and (ii) if AS Persons collectively then hold, directly or indirectly (other than through PubCo and its Subsidiaries), more than 5% of the outstanding Common Units in the aggregate, the AS
Representative, then the Company may cause all outstanding Common Units then held by all Members to be redeemed;

(b) if (i) the
Members (other than the PubCo Members) hold less than 10% of the then-outstanding Common Units and (ii) AS Persons collectively then hold, directly or indirectly (other than through PubCo and its Subsidiaries), less than 5% of the outstanding
Common Units in the aggregate, then the Company may cause all outstanding Common Units then held by all Members to be redeemed;

(c) if at
any time either (i) AS Persons collectively own, directly or indirectly (other than through PubCo and its Subsidiaries), less than 5% of the then outstanding Common Units in the aggregate, or (ii) the Company has more than 85 partners,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)
(determined by taking into account Treasury Regulations
Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)),
then the
Company may cause the then-held Common Units of any or all Members who hold less than 1% of the Common Units then outstanding (excluding all Common Units held by PubCo Members) to be redeemed;

(d) in connection with (i) any Involuntary Transfer by any Member (other than a PubCo Member), the Company may cause any or all Common
Units then held by such Member or transferee in such Involuntary Transfer (if applicable) to be redeemed, or (ii) any Corresponding Involuntary Transfer, the Company may cause the Common Units then held by Management Holdings corresponding to
such Corresponding Management Units to be redeemed;

(e) If, following the Management Elective Redemption Date, any Management Holdings
Partner becomes a Member of this Agreement in connection with effecting a substantially concurrent Redemption of such Person’s Units pursuant to
Article XI
and such Person does not (i) deliver a Redemption Notice within three
(3) Business Days of being admitted as a Member (provided that Management Holdings has not delivered a Redemption Notice with respect to such Units on behalf of such Management Holdings Partner prior to such date) or (ii) effect such
Redemption or Direct Exchange within three (3) Business Days of the date on which such Redemption or Direct Exchange was intended to be consummated, then, with the Manager’s consent, the Company may cause all outstanding Common Units then
held by such Member (and which, for avoidance of doubt, were received as a Permitted Transfer pursuant to
Section
10.02(ii)(B)
) to be redeemed (this clause (e) and the foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d), a
“
Company Redemption Right
”).



58



The Company shall exercise the Company Redemption Right by delivering written notice to each Member whose
Common Units are the subject of the Redemption (the “
Company Redemption
Notice
”) not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed Redemption Date, which notice shall specify the Redemption Date
and whether the redemption shall be effected through a Cash Settlement, a Share Settlement or a Direct Exchange. The Member whose Common Units are the subject of the Company Redemption Notice shall not have the right to deliver a Retraction Notice
or otherwise cancel or reverse the Company’s decision to proceed with the Redemption. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section
11.07
, the Company Redemption Right shall be settled in accordance with the provisions
of this
Article XI
. Notwithstanding anything in this
Article XI
, the Company’s right to cause a Redemption and/or Direct Exchange under this
Section
11.07
shall apply to any and all Common Units
(including Unvested Units, if any) and any shares received in exchange for or redemption of any such Unvested Units shall be subject to the same vesting conditions and in the same proportions as such Unvested Units. In connection with the
Company’s exercise of a Company Redemption Right, any Member subject to such right agrees to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with consummating the exercise of such Company Redemption Right,
including executing and delivering such documents as may be reasonably requested in order to consummate the exercise of such Company Redemption Right and making such representations, warranties and covenants as are customary for similar
redemption transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Common Units shall in no event be subject to a Company Redemption Right unless, in the event of a Share Settlement of such Company Redemption Right, (x) there is an active shelf
registration statement in effect with respect to all of the Common Units that would be subject to Redemption and (y) the Class A Common Stock issuable in connection with such Redemption shall not be subject to any
lock-up
or other restrictions on transfer.

Section 11.08.
Policies
. All Redemptions
pursuant to this
Article XI
shall be subject to any formal policies or procedures implemented by the Manager in connection with the administration or facilitation of Redemptions and Direct Exchanges hereunder, as such policies or procedures
may be modified, amended or supplemented from time to time.

Section 11.09.
Management Holdings
.

(a) By virtue of their ownership of Corresponding Management Units, Management Holdings Partners indirectly hold interests in the Company. In
applying the provisions of this Agreement (other than
Section
11.01(b)
prior to the Management Elective Redemption Date) and in order to determine equitably the rights and obligations of Management Holdings and the
Management Holdings Partners, the Manager, the Company, PubCo and/or Management Holdings may treat (a) the Common Units held by Management Holdings as if they were hypothetically directly held by the Management Holdings Partners having an
indirect economic interest therein and (b) any Management Holdings Partner as if it were hypothetically a Member with a corresponding interest in a proportionate portion of the Common Units owned by such Management Holdings Partner.
Accordingly, with respect to Management Holdings, upon (i) any issuance of additional Units or other Equity Securities of the Company to Management Holdings for the benefit of any Management Holdings Partner (or the occurrence of any event that
causes the repurchase, redemption or forfeiture of any Units), (ii) the Transfer of Units by Management Holdings or (iii) any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, issuance of debt or any other
similar capital transaction of the Company (each, a “
Management Holdings Action
”), Management Holdings and/or the Manager, as applicable, may take any action or make any adjustment with respect to the Corresponding
Management Units to



59



replicate, as closely as possible, such Management Holdings Action (including the effects thereof). Likewise, if Management Holdings takes any action with respect to its own securities that would
be a Management Holdings Action if such action were taken by the Company with respect to its securities (to the extent permitted by this Agreement and the Management Holdings Agreement), the Manager may take any action or make any adjustment with
respect to the Common Units to replicate, as closely as possible, such action (including the effects thereof). The Members shall take all actions reasonably requested by the Manager in connection with any Management Holdings Action and this

Section
11.09(a)
to the extent not inconsistent with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section
11.09(a)
shall (i) require or authorize any issuance, cancellation,
reclassification or other change to Units except as permitted by, and subject to,
Article III
(including
Section
3.02
and
Section
3.04
), (ii) be construed to modify the one-to-one
maintenance and capitalization mechanics set forth in
Section
3.04
, (iii) alter or override the application of any provision of this Agreement that expressly references Management Holdings, (iv) confer Member status on
any Management Holdings Partner, except as provided in
Article XII
, or (v) modify this
Article XI
(including as to timing, eligibility or other limitations hereunder).

(b) Without limiting the generality of
Section
11.01(i)
, following the Management Elective Redemption Date, for
purposes of determining the applicability of any contractual
lock-up
period or Redemption
Black-Out
Period or the Redemption Date, if the Redeeming Member is Management
Holdings, then such determination shall be made by reference to the applicable Management Holdings Partner holding Corresponding Management Units corresponding to the Redeemed Units (or portion thereof) subject to such Redemption.

Substituted Members
. Subject to the provisions of
Article X

admission shall be shown on the books and records of the Company, including the Schedule of Members (subject to
Section
10.07(a)
). Following admission, the Substituted Member shall enter into such additional documentation,
if any, as the Manager reasonably and in good faith requests in connection with the Substituted Member’s admission and status as a Member.

Section 12.02.

Article X
hereof, any Person that is not a Member as of the
Effective Date (and is not a Permitted Transferee) may be admitted to the Company as an additional Member (any such Person, an “
Additional Member
”)

only upon furnishing to the Manager (a) duly executed
Joinder and counterparts to any applicable Other Agreements and (b) such other documents or instruments as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect such Person’s admission as a
Member (including entering
into such documents as may reasonably be requested by the Manager). Such admission shall become effective on the date on which the Manager determines in its sole discretion that such conditions have been satisfied and when any such admission is
shown on the books and records of the Company, including the Schedule of Members.

dissolution and winding up of the Company pursuant to
Article XIV

, such Member
shall cease to be a Member.

ARTICLE XIV

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

Section 14.01.
Dissolution
. The Company shall not be dissolved by the admission of Additional Members or Substituted Members or
the attempted withdrawal, removal, dissolution, Bankruptcy or resignation of a Member. The Company shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon:

(a) the decision of the Manager together with the written approval of the Common Unitholders holding a majority of the Common Units to
dissolve the Company (excluding for purposes of such calculation the PubCo Members and all Common Units held thereby);

(b) a dissolution
of the Company under
Section 18-801(4)
of the Delaware Act, unless the Company is continued without dissolution pursuant thereto; or

(c) the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Company under
Section 18-802
of the
Delaware Act.

Except as otherwise set forth in this
Article XIV
, the Company is intended to have perpetual existence. An Event of Withdrawal shall
not in and of itself cause a dissolution of the Company and the Company shall continue in existence subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 14.02.
Winding up
. Subject to
Section
14.05
, on dissolution of the Company, the Manager shall
act as liquidating trustee or may appoint one or more Persons as liquidating trustee (each such Person, a “
Liquidator
”)
.

The Liquidators shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of the Company
and make final distributions as provided herein and in the Delaware Act. The costs of liquidation shall be borne as an expense of the Company. Until final distribution, the Liquidators shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
continue to operate the properties of the Company with all of the power and authority of the Manager. The steps to be accomplished by the Liquidators are as follows:

(a) as promptly as possible after dissolution and again after final liquidation, the Liquidators shall cause a proper accounting to be made by
a recognized firm of certified public accountants of the Company’s assets, liabilities and operations through the last day of the calendar month in which the dissolution occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as applicable;



61



(b) the Liquidators shall pay, satisfy or discharge from the Company’s funds, or
otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof (including the establishment of a cash fund for contingent, conditional and unmatured liabilities in such amount and for such term as the liquidators may reasonably determine) the
following: first, all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company owed to creditors other than the Members in satisfaction of the liabilities of the Company (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof),
including all expenses incurred in connection with the liquidations; and second, all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company owed to the Members (other than any payments or distributions owed to such Members in their capacity as
Members pursuant to this Agreement); and

(c) following any payments pursuant to the foregoing
Section
14.02(b)
,
all remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed to the Members in accordance with
Section
4.01(a)
by the end of the Taxable Year during which the liquidation of the Company occurs (or, if later, by ninety
(90) days after the date of the liquidation).

The distribution of cash and/or property to the Members in accordance with the
provisions of this
Section
14.02
and
Section
14.03
below shall constitute a complete return to the Members of their Capital Contributions, a complete distribution to the Members of their interest
in the Company and all of the Company’s property and shall constitute a compromise to which all Members have consented within the meaning of the Delaware Act. To the extent that a Member returns funds to the Company, it has no claim against
any other Member for those funds.

Section 14.03.
Deferment Distribution in Kind
. Notwithstanding the provisions of

Section
14.02
, but subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, if upon dissolution of the Company the Liquidators determine that an immediate sale of part or all of the Company’s assets would be impractical
or would cause undue loss (or would otherwise not be beneficial) to the Members, the Liquidators may, in their sole discretion and the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those
necessary to satisfy the Company’s liabilities (other than loans to the Company by any Member(s)) and reserves. Subject to the order of priorities set forth in
Section
14.02
, the Liquidators may, in their sole
discretion, distribute to the Members, in lieu of cash, either (a) all or any portion of such remaining assets
in-kind
of the Company in accordance with the provisions of

Section
14.02(c)
, (b) as tenants in common and in accordance with the provisions of
Section
14.02(c)
, undivided interests in all or any portion of such assets of the Company or (c) a
combination of the foregoing. Any such Distributions
in-kind
shall be subject to (x) such conditions relating to the disposition and management of such assets as the Liquidators deem reasonable and
equitable and (y) the terms and conditions of any agreements governing such assets (or the operation thereof or the holders thereof) at such time. Any assets of the Company distributed in kind will first be written up or down to their Fair
Market Value, thus creating Profit or Loss (if any), which shall be allocated in accordance with
Article V
. The Liquidators shall determine the Fair Market Value of any property distributed.

Section 14.04.
Cancellation of Certificate
. On completion of the winding up of the Company as provided herein, the Manager (or
such other Person or Persons as the Delaware Act may require or permit) shall file a certificate of cancellation of the Certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, cancel any other filings made pursuant to this Agreement that should be
canceled and take such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the existence of the Company. The Company shall continue in existence for all purposes of this Agreement until it is terminated pursuant to this

Section
14.04
.



62



Section 14.05.
Reasonable Time for Winding Up
. A reasonable time shall be
allowed for the orderly winding up of the business and affairs of the Company and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to
Sections 14.02
and
14.03
in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up.

Section 14.06.
Return of Capital
. The Liquidators shall not be personally liable for the return of Capital Contributions or any
portion thereof to the Members (it being understood that any such return shall be made solely from assets of the Company).

SECTION
2.01.
Demand Registration

(a)
Demand by Sponsor Holders
. Following the IPO, at any time, any Sponsor Holder may make a
written request, in each case, subject to
Section
2.11
(a “
Demand Notice
”) to the Company for Registration of all or part of the Registrable Securities held by the Sponsor Holders (i) on Form
S-1
(a “
Long-Form Registration
”), provided that the Sponsor Holders shall be limited to a total of three (3) such requests (or an unlimited number if the Sponsor Holder delivers a Demand
Notice more than twelve calendar months following the IPO, but the Company is not eligible to Register on
Form S-3
at the time of the delivery of the Demand Notice), or (ii) on Form
S-3
(a “
Short Form Registration
”) if the Company qualifies to use such short form (any such requested Long-Form Registration or Short-Form Registration, a “
Demand
Registration
”). Each Demand Notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities of the Sponsor Holders to be registered and the intended methods of disposition thereof. Subject to
Section
2.11
,
after delivery of such Demand Notice, the Company (x) shall file promptly (and in any event, within (i) ninety (90) days in the case of a request for a Long-Form Registration or (ii) thirty (30) days in the case of a request for a
Short-Form Registration, in each case following delivery of such Demand Notice) with the SEC a Registration Statement (which the Company shall designate as an automatically effective Registration Statement if the Company qualifies at such time to
file such a Registration Statement) relating to such Demand Registration (a “
Demand Registration Statement
”), and (y) shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Demand Registration Statement to promptly be declared
effective under (x) the Securities Act (if such Registration Statement is not automatically effective) and (y) the “Blue Sky” laws of such jurisdictions as any Participating Holder or any underwriter, if any, reasonably
requests.

(b)
Demand Withdrawal
. The Sponsor Holders may withdraw their Registrable Securities from a Demand Registration at any
time prior to the effectiveness of the applicable Demand Registration Statement. Upon delivery of a notice by the Sponsor Holders to such effect, the Company shall cease all efforts to secure effectiveness of the applicable Demand Registration
Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sponsor Holders shall not have any liability or obligation to any other Holder following their determination to terminate, withdraw, and/or delay any Demand Registration initiated by them under this

Section
2.01
. Any withdrawal of a Demand Registration shall count as a Demand Registration for purposes of calculating the number of demands initiated by the Sponsor Holders unless the Company is reimbursed for its pro rata
portion of the Registration Expenses incurred in such Demand Registration through the time of such withdrawal.

(c)
Demand Company
Notice
. Subject to
Section
2.11,
promptly upon delivery of any Demand Notice (but in no event (i) more than two (2) Business Days following delivery of such Demand Notice or (ii) less than fifteen
(15) Business Days prior to the anticipated filing date of such Demand Registration Statement ), the Company shall deliver a written notice (a “
Demand Company Notice
”) of any such Registration request to all Holders (other
than the Sponsor Holders exercising demand rights pursuant to
Section
2.01(a)
), and the Company shall include in such Demand Registration all such Registrable Securities of such Holders which the Company has



8



received written requests for inclusion therein within fifteen (15) days after the date that such Demand Company Notice has been delivered. All requests made pursuant to this

shall specify the aggregate amount of Registrable Securities of such Holder to be registered. For the avoidance of doubt, the Management Holdings Holder following the Management Elective Redemption Date

(d)
Delay in
Filing; Suspension of Registration
. If the Company shall furnish to the Participating Holders a certificate signed by the Chief Executive Officer or equivalent senior executive officer of the Company stating that the filing, effectiveness, or
continued use of a Demand Registration Statement would require the Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, then the Company may delay the filing (but not the preparation of) or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, the Demand Registration
Statement (a “
Demand Suspension
”);
provided
,
however
, that the Company, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Sponsor Holders exercising demand rights pursuant to Section 2.01(a), shall not be permitted to
exercise a Demand Suspension or Shelf Suspension more than once, or for more than sixty (60) days, in each case, during any twelve (12) month period;
provided
,
further
, that in the event of a Demand Suspension, such Demand
Suspension shall terminate at such earlier time as the Company would no longer be required to make any Adverse Disclosure. Each Participating Holder shall keep confidential the fact that a Demand Suspension is in effect, the certificate referred to
above and its contents unless and until otherwise notified by the Company, except (A) for disclosure to such Participating Holder’s employees, agents, and professional advisers who reasonably need to know such information for purposes of
assisting the Participating Holder with respect to its investment in the Company Shares and agree to keep it confidential, (B) for disclosures to the extent required in order to comply with reporting obligations to its limited partners or other
direct or indirect investors who have agreed to keep such information confidential, (C) if and to the extent such matters are publicly disclosed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person that, to the actual knowledge of such
Participating Holder, was not subject to an obligation or duty of confidentiality to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (D) as required by law, rule, or regulation, (E) for disclosures to potential limited partners or investors of a
Participating Holder who have agreed to keep such information confidential, and (F) for disclosures to potential transferees of a Holder’s Registrable Securities who have agreed to keep such information confidential. In the case of a
Demand Suspension, the Participating Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon delivery of
the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify the Participating Holders upon the termination of any Demand Suspension, and (i) in the case of a Demand Registration Statement that has not been declared effective, shall
promptly thereafter file the Demand Registration Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to have such Demand Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act and (ii) in the case of an effective Demand Registration
Statement, shall amend or supplement the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading and furnish to the Participating Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Participating Holders may reasonably request.
The Company agrees, if necessary, to supplement or make amendments to the Demand Registration Statement if required by the registration form used by the Company for the applicable Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration
form or by the Securities Act, or as may reasonably be requested by the Sponsor Holders exercising demand rights pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

Section
2.01(a)
so request, an offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration shall be in the form of an Underwritten Offering, and such Sponsor Holders shall have the right to select the
managing underwriter or underwriters to administer the offering. If such Sponsor Holders intend to sell the Registrable Securities covered by their demand by means of an Underwritten Offering, such Sponsor Holders shall so advise the Company as part
of its Demand Notice, and the Company shall include such information in the Demand Company Notice.

provided to the Sponsor Holders requesting participation in such Demand Registration) that, in its or their opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such Demand Registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such offering
without being likely to have a significant adverse effect on the price, timing, or distribution of the securities offered or the market for the securities offered, the securities to be included in such Demand Registration (i)
first
,
shall be allocated
pro rata
among the Sponsor Holders that have requested to participate in such Demand Registration based on the relative number of Registrable Securities then held by each such Sponsor Holder (
provided

securities thereby allocated to a Sponsor Holder that exceed such Sponsor Holder’s request shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting Sponsor Holders in like manner), (ii)
second
, and only if all the securities referred to
in clause (i) have been included in such Demand Registration, shall be allocated
pro rata
among the Holders (excluding the Sponsor Holders, as applicable) that have requested to participate in such Demand Registration based on the
relative number of Registrable Securities then held by each such Holder (
provided
, that any securities thereby allocated to a Holder that exceed such Holder’s request shall be reallocated among the remaining requesting Holders in like
manner), (iii)
third

Eligibility Date, the Company shall not be obligated to file (but shall be obligated to prepare) such Shelf
Registration Statement on
Form S-3.
If the Company then qualifies as a WKSI, then if requested by the Sponsor Holders holding a majority of the Registrable Securities then held by the Sponsor Holders, the
Shelf Registration Statement shall include an unspecified amount of Registrable Securities to be sold by unspecified Holders.

(ii) Subject to the right to deliver a Shelf Notice in the manner contemplated by the first proviso below, at any time

Statement to be promptly declared effective under the Securities Act. If, on the date of any such request (or, in the event of a request that is delivered prior to the end of the twelfth calendar month following the IPO, on the first day of the
thirteenth calendar month following the IPO), the Company does not qualify to file a Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act, the provisions of this
Section
2.02

Securities or (ii) such shorter period as the Sponsor Holders with respect to such Shelf Registration shall agree in writing (such period of effectiveness, the “
Shelf Period
”). Subject to

Section
2.02(d)
, the Company shall not be deemed to have used its reasonable best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during the Shelf Period if the Company voluntarily takes any action or omits to
take any action that would result in Shelf Holders not being able to offer and sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement during the Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is (x) a Shelf Suspension
permitted pursuant to
Section
2.02(d)
or (y) required by applicable law, rule, or regulation.

(c)

provided
, that the Company shall not include in such Shelf Registration Registrable Securities of any Holder (other than the Sponsor Holders) in an amount in excess of such

case of a Shelf Registration Statement that has not been declared effective, shall promptly thereafter file the Shelf Registration Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to have such Shelf Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act and (ii) in the case of an effective Shelf Registration Statement, shall (x) amend or supplement the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and furnish to the Shelf Holders such numbers of copies of the Prospectus and any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus as so
amended or supplemented as the Shelf Holders may reasonably request and (y) if applicable, cause any post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement to become effective. The Company agrees, if necessary, to supplement or make
amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement if required by the registration form used by the Company for the applicable Registration or by the instructions applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder, or as may reasonably be requested by the Sponsor Holders.

Holders, each of their respective direct or indirect partners, members, managers, or shareholders and each of such partner’s, member’s or shareholder’s partners, members, managers, or shareholders and, with respect to all of the
foregoing Persons, each of their respective Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, trustees, or agents and each Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) such Persons and each of their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, penalties, judgments, suits, costs, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, joint or several (including reasonable costs of preparation and investigation and legal expenses) (each, a
“
Loss
” and collectively, “
Losses
”) arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable
Securities were Registered under the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary, or summary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), any Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, or any other disclosure document produced by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries including reports and other documents filed under the Exchange Act, (ii) any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, or Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not misleading, (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company of any federal, state, or common law rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any such registration,
qualification, compliance, or sale of Registrable Securities, (iv) any failure to register or qualify Registrable Securities in any state where the Company or its agents have affirmatively undertaken or agreed in writing that the Company (the
undertaking of any underwriter being attributed to the Company) will undertake such registration or qualification on behalf of the Holders of such Registrable Securities, or (v) any actions or inactions or proceedings in respect of the
foregoing whether or not such indemnified party is a party thereto, and the Company will reimburse, as incurred, each such Holder and each of their respective direct or indirect partners, members, or shareholders and each of such partner’s,
member’s, or shareholder’s partners, members, or shareholders and, with respect to all of the foregoing Persons, each of their respective Affiliates, employees, directors, officers, trustees, or agents and controlling Persons and each of
their respective Representatives, for any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred



27



in connection with investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability, or action;
provided
, that no Participating Holder shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section in respect of any untrue statement or omission contained in any information relating to such Participating Holder furnished in writing by such Participating Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in a Registration Statement
and used by the Company in conformity therewith (such information “
Selling Stockholder Information
”). This indemnity shall be in addition to any liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in full force
and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of such Holder or any indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Holder. The Company shall also indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer
managers, and similar securities industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of the indemnified parties.

(b)
Indemnification by the Participating Holders
.
Each Participating Holder agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act), from and against any Losses resulting from (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were Registered under
the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary, or summary Prospectus contained therein or any amendment or supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or amendment or
supplement thereto, or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, or Issuer Free Writing
Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) or omission (or alleged omission) is contained in such
Participating Holder’s Selling Stockholder Information. In no event shall the liability of such Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder under the sale of Registrable Securities
giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

(c)
Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings
. Any Person entitled to indemnification
under this
Section
2.09
shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification (
provided
, that any delay or failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is actually and materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party to
assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party;
provided
, that any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select and employ separate counsel and to participate in
the defense of such claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Person unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such fees or expenses, (B) the indemnifying party shall have failed
to assume the defense of such claim within a reasonable time after delivery of notice of such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (C) the indemnified party has
reasonably concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or in addition to



28



those available to the indemnifying party, or (D) in the reasonable judgment of any such Person (based upon advice of its counsel) a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and
the indemnifying party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party shall not
have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of such Person). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to settle such action, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement, in each case without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, unless the entry of such judgment or settlement (i) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party
of an unconditional release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party, and

provided
, that any sums payable in connection with such settlement are paid in full by the indemnifying party. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made without its prior written consent, but such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. It is understood that the indemnifying party or parties shall not, except as specifically set forth in this

Section
2.09(c)
, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements or other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in
such jurisdiction at any one time unless (x) the employment of more than one counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties, (y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on the advice of counsel)
that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified parties, or (z) a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based upon advice of counsel to an
indemnified party) between such indemnified party and the other indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel or counsels.

(d)
Contribution
. If for any reason the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this

Section
2.09
is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to therein (other than as a result of exceptions or limitations on indemnification contained in

Section
2.09
), then the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the acts, statements, or omissions that resulted in such losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. In connection with
any Registration Statement filed with the SEC by the Company, the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section
2.09(d)
were determined by
pro
rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
Section
2.09(d)
. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent



29



misrepresentation. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in
Sections
2.09(a)
and
2.09(b)
shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this

Section
2.09(d)
, in connection with any Registration Statement filed by the Company, a Participating Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar amount of the net proceeds received by such
Holder under the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to such contribution obligation less any amount paid by such Holders pursuant to
Section
2.08(b)
. If indemnification is available under this

Section
2.09
, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in
Sections
2.09(a)
and
Section
2.08(b)
hereof without regard to
the provisions of this
Section
2.09(d)
.

(e)
No Exclusivity
. The remedies provided for in this

Section
2.09
are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity or pursuant to any other agreement.

(f)
Indemnification Priority
. The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that any of the Persons entitled to indemnification pursuant
to this
Section
2.09
(each, a “
Company Indemnitee
” and collectively, the “
Company Indemnitees
”) may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, and/or insurance
provided by other sources. The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees (i) that it is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to a Company Indemnitee are primary and any obligation of such other sources to advance expenses or to
provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by such Company Indemnitee are secondary) and (ii) that it shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by a Company Indemnitee and shall be liable for
the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as required by the terms of this Agreement without regard to any rights a Company Indemnitee may have against such other
sources. The Company further agrees that no advancement or payment by such other sources on behalf of a Company Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which such Company Indemnitee has sought indemnification, advancement of expenses or insurance
from the Company shall affect the foregoing, and that such other sources shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of such Company Indemnitee against the
Company.

(g)
Conflicts
. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution
contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions in this
Section
2.08
, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall
control.

(h)
Survival
. The indemnities provided in this
Section
2.09
shall survive the transfer of any
Registrable Securities by such Holder.

SECTION 2.10.

The Company covenants that it
will file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the reasonable request

to enable the Holders, following the IPO, to sell Registrable Securities without Registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rules 144, 144A, or Regulation S under the Securities Act, as
such Rules may be amended from time to time, or (ii) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the reasonable request of a Holder, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied
with such requirements and, if not, the specifics thereof.

SECTION 2.11.
Limitation on Registrations and Underwritten Offerings
.
Notwithstanding the rights and obligations set forth in
Sections 2.01
and
2.02
, in no event shall the Company be obligated to take any action to (i) effect more than one Marketed Underwritten Offering initiated by the Sponsor
Holders in any consecutive
90-day
period or (ii) effect any Underwritten Offering unless the Holders initiating such Underwritten Offering propose to sell Registrable Securities in such Underwritten
Offering having a reasonably anticipated gross aggregate price (before deduction of underwriter commissions and offering expenses) of at least $10,000,000.

SECTION 2.12.

this Agreement, the Company agrees not to effect (other than pursuant to the Registration applicable to such Underwritten Offering or pursuant to a Special Registration) any public sale or distribution, or to file any Registration Statement (other
than pursuant to the Registration applicable to such Underwritten Offering or pursuant to a Special Registration) covering any of its Company Shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, during the
period not to exceed ten (10) days prior and sixty (60) days following the effective date of such offering or such longer period up to ninety (90) days as may be requested by the managing underwriter for such Underwritten Offering;

Distributions
. If the Sponsor Holders, as Investment Funds or Affiliates of Investment Funds, seek to effectuate an
in-kind
distribution to its direct or indirect
equityholders, the Company will reasonably cooperate with and assist the Sponsor Holders, such equityholders and the Company’s transfer agent to facilitate such
in-kind

SECTION 2.14.
Margin Loan and Pledge Transactions
. If requested by the Sponsor
Holders in connection with any transaction involving Registrable Securities (including any margin loan with respect to such securities and any pledge of such securities), the Company will provide the Sponsor Holders with customary assistance to
facilitate such transaction or similar transaction, including, without limitation entering into an “issuer’s agreement” in connection with any margin loan with respect to such securities in customary form. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that the Sponsor Holders may from time to time pledge pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement with a registered broker-dealer or grant a security interest in some or all of the Registrable Securities
to a financial institution that is an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act and, if required under the terms of such arrangement, the Sponsor Holders may transfer pledged or secured
Registrable Securities to the pledgees or secured parties. Such a pledge or transfer would not be subject to approval of the Company and no notice shall be required of such pledge. The Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation

Section
2.01
,
Section
2.02

at any time and from time to time (including after receiving information regarding any potential Public Offering), to elect to not receive any notice that the Company or any other Holders otherwise are required to deliver pursuant to this Agreement
by delivering to the Company a written statement signed by such Holder that it does not want to receive any notices hereunder (an “
Opt-Out
Request
”); in which case and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement the Company and other Holders shall not be required to, and shall not, deliver any notice or other information required to be provided to Holders hereunder to the extent that the Company or such other
Holders reasonably expect would result in a Holder acquiring MNPI. An
Opt-Out
Request may state a date on which it expires or, if no such date is specified, shall remain in effect indefinitely. A Holder who
previously has given the Company an
Opt-Out
Request may revoke such request at any time, and there shall be no limit on the ability of a Holder to issue and revoke subsequent

Opt-Out
Requests;
provided

that each Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the administrative burden on the Company arising in connection with any such
Opt-Out
Requests.

Actual Tax Liability
” means, with respect to any Taxable Year,

interest) under Section 6225 or any similar provision of the Code that is allocable to any PubCo Group Member under Section 704 of the Code or otherwise attributable to any PubCo Group Member in accordance with the OpCo Agreement and
(ii) the product of the amount of the U.S. federal taxable income for such taxable year reported on PubCo’s IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) (calculated by excluding deductions for state and local Taxes) and the Blended Rate.

“
Affiliate
” means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more
intermediaries, Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with, such first Person.

to any Exchange TRA Party or any Reorganization TRA Party, as the case may be, determined under the following principles:

(i) any Blocker Attributes are Attributable to the Blocker Shareholders and the AS General Partner in proportion to the number
of Acquired Units contributed to PubCo as a result of the contributions of equity interests of the Blockers and GP NewCo in the Reorganization;

(ii) any Reorganization Transferred Basis shall be determined on an aggregate basis with respect to the Blocker Shareholders
and the AS General Partner and separately for each other Reorganization TRA Party and is Attributable to each Reorganization TRA Party in accordance with Section 2.3(b)(iv) of this Agreement;

(v) any Basis Adjustments shall be determined separately with respect to each Exchange TRA Party and are Attributable to the
Exchange TRA Party that engaged in the Exchange (for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Basis Adjustments attributable to a distribution or redemption, the relevant Exchange TRA Party shall be the Exchange TRA Party relinquishing its
interest in the Reference Asset); and

(vi) any deduction to any PubCo Group Member with respect to a Taxable Year in
respect of Imputed Interest is Attributable to the Person that is required to include the Imputed Interest in income (without regard to whether such Person is actually subject to Tax thereon).

“
Attribute Schedule

“
Available TRA Attribute Claim
” means, with respect to each of the TRA Parties and any Taxable Year, the difference
between (a) the TRA Party’s TRA Attribute Claim Amortization for the current Taxable Year and all prior Taxable Years and (b) the amount of the TRA Party’s TRA Attribute Claim Amortization that has resulted in a Realized Tax
Benefit attributable to the Exchange Basis or Reorganization Transferred Basis that has been treated as Attributable to such TRA Party pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(iv) for all prior Taxable Years.

“
Basis Adjustment
” means any adjustment to the Tax basis of a Reference Asset under Sections 707(a), 732, 734(b),
737, 743(b), 754 and/or 1012 of the Code, in each case, as a result of an Exchange and the payments made pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Exchange. For the avoidance of doubt, the amount of any Basis Adjustment resulting from an
Exchange of one or more Units shall be determined without regard to any
Pre-Exchange

Pre-Exchange
Transfer had not occurred. The amount of any
Basis Adjustment shall be determined using the Market Value of the Units that are the subject of the Exchange at the time of the Exchange.

“
Basis Sharing Percentage
” means, with respect to any Tax Benefit Payment, a fraction, (i) the numerator of
which equals the Available TRA Attribute Claim associated with the Acquired Units, in the case of any Reorganization TRA Party, or the Units transferred upon an Exchange, in the case of any Exchange TRA Party, and (ii) the denominator of which
equals the sum of all Available TRA Attribute Claims. The Basis Sharing Percentage associated with the Acquired Units indirectly acquired from the AS General Partner and the Blocker Shareholders in the Reorganization shall be determined on an
aggregate basis for the AS General Partner and the Blocker Shareholders and apportioned among such Persons based on the relative number of Acquired Units indirectly contributed by them in the Reorganization.

“
Beneficial Owner
” means, with respect to any security, a Person who directly or indirectly, through any contract,
arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, such security; and/or (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose of, or
to direct the disposition of, such security. The terms “
Beneficially Own
” and “
Beneficial Ownership
” shall have correlative meanings.



4



“
Blended Rate
” means, with respect to any Taxable Year, the sum of
the effective rates of Tax (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any U.S. federal benefit of the state or local tax deduction) imposed on the aggregate net income of the PubCo Group Members in each state or local jurisdiction in which the
PubCo Group Members file Tax Returns for such Taxable Year, with the effective rate in any state or local jurisdiction (before taking into account any U.S. federal benefit of the state or local tax deduction) being equal to the product of
(i) the apportionment factor on PubCo’s income or franchise Tax Return in such jurisdiction for such Taxable Year and (ii) the maximum applicable corporate Tax rate in effect in such jurisdiction in such Taxable Year. As an
illustration of the calculation of the Blended Rate for a Taxable Year (before taking into account any U.S. federal benefit of the state or local tax deduction), if the PubCo Group Members solely file Tax Returns in State 1 and State 2 in a Taxable
Year, the maximum applicable corporate Tax rates in effect in such states in such Taxable Year are 6.5% and 5.5%, respectively, and the apportionment factors for such states in such Taxable Year are 55% and 45% respectively, then the Blended Rate
for such Taxable Year is equal to 6.05% (i.e., 6.5% multiplied by 55% plus 5.5% multiplied by 45%).

“
Blocker
Attributes
” means, without duplication, the net operating losses, capital losses, and disallowed business interest expense carryforwards or excess business interest expense under Section 163(j) of the Code (and any comparable
provision of U.S. federal Tax law) that any PubCo Group Member is entitled to utilize as a result of any Blocker’s participation in the Reorganization that relate to taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the effective
date of the Reorganization; provided, however, that for purposes of determining whether any such Tax attribute is a Blocker Attribute, the Taxable Year of the PubCo Group Members and each Blocker that includes the effective date of the
Reorganization shall be deemed to end as of the close of such effective date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Blocker Attribute” shall not include any Tax attribute of a Blocker that is used to offset Taxes of such Blocker, if
such offset Taxes are attributable to taxable periods (or any portion thereof) ending on or prior to the effective date of the Reorganization.

“
Blockers
” means (i) SOLV Blocker and (ii) SOLV Sub 2 Inc., a Delaware corporation that was converted from
a Delaware limited partnership named ASP VIII CSE LP in connection with the Reorganization, and, in each case, any predecessor or successor thereto (including by operation of law).

“
Blocker Shareholders
” means [●] and [●] (and, in each case, any successor thereto or any permitted
transferee thereof).

“
Board
” means the Board of Directors of PubCo.

“
Business Day
” means each day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banking institutions in New York,
New York or San Diego, California are authorized or required by law to close.

” means the occurrence of any of the following

serving: individuals who, on the IPO Date, constitute the Board and any new director whose appointment or election by the Board or nomination for election by PubCo’s stockholders was approved or recommended by a vote of at least
one-half
of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the IPO Date or whose appointment, election or nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended by the directors referred

Schedule will become final and binding on the Parties pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.4(a) and may be amended by the Parties pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.4(b) (subject to the procedures set forth in
Section 2.4). All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision and preparation of the Attribute Schedules and Tax Benefit Schedules (as defined below) for each TRA Party in compliance with this Agreement shall be borne by OpCo.


SECTION
2.3

Tax Benefit Schedule
.

(a)
Tax Benefit Schedule
. Within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after the due date (including extensions) of IRS Form
1120 (or any successor form) of PubCo for any Taxable Year in which there is a Realized Tax Benefit or a Realized Tax Detriment Attributable to a TRA Party, PubCo shall provide to the TRA Party Representative a schedule showing, in reasonable
detail, the calculation of the Realized Tax Benefit and Tax Benefit Payment or the Realized Tax Detriment, as applicable, in respect of each TRA Party for such Taxable Year (a “
Tax Benefit Schedule
”). Each Tax Benefit
Schedule will become final as provided in Section 2.4(a) and may be amended as provided in Section 2.4(b) (subject to the procedures set forth in Section 2.4).

(b)
Applicable Principles
.

(i)
General
. Subject to Section 3.3, the Realized Tax Benefit (or the Realized Tax Detriment) for each Taxable
Year is intended to measure the decrease (or increase) in the actual liability for Taxes of the PubCo Group Members for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax Attributes, determined using a “with and without” methodology. Carryovers
or carrybacks of any Tax item attributable to any of the Tax Attributes shall be considered to be subject to the rules of the Code and the Treasury Regulations governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of the relevant
type. If a carryover or carryback of any Tax item includes a portion that is attributable to any Tax Attribute and another portion that is not, such portions shall be considered to be used in accordance with the “with and without”
methodology.

(ii)
Treatment of Tax Benefit Payments
. The parties agree that (A) all Tax Benefit Payments
(other than Imputed Interest thereon) attributable to Blocker Attributes or Reorganization Transferred Basis will be treated as other property or money for purposes of Section 351 of the Code or otherwise as consideration received in the
Reorganization, (B) all Tax Benefit Payments (other than Imputed Interest thereon) attributable to the IPO Basis (including Reorganization Transferred Basis resulting from



17



Tax Benefit Payments attributable to the IPO Basis) Attributable to any Reorganization TRA Party will be treated as other property or money for purposes of Section 351 of the Code or
otherwise as consideration received in the Reorganization (which, with respect to the PubCo Unit Contributions, will have the effect of creating additional Reorganization Transferred Basis with respect to Reference Assets for the PubCo Group Members
in the year of payment), (C) all Tax Benefit Payments (other than Imputed Interest thereon) attributable to the Exchange Basis or Basis Adjustments (other than Basis Adjustments resulting from Tax Benefit Payments attributable to the IPO Basis) will
be treated as subsequent upward purchase price adjustments with respect to the Units exchanged in the applicable Exchange that have the effect of creating additional Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for the PubCo Group Members in the year of
payment, (D) all Tax Benefit Payments (other than Imputed Interest thereon) attributable to the IPO Basis (including Basis Adjustments resulting from Tax Benefit Payments attributable to the IPO Basis) Attributable to any Exchange TRA Party
will be treated as subsequent upward purchase price adjustments with respect to the Threshold Exchange Units that have the effect of creating additional Basis Adjustments to Reference Assets for the PubCo Group Members in the year of payment,
(E) the Actual Tax Liability will take into account the deduction of the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment that must be accounted for as Imputed Interest, and (F) as a result, any additional Basis Adjustments (and, in the case of the
PubCo Unit Contributions, any additional Reorganization Transferred Basis) will be incorporated into the current year calculation and into future year calculations, as appropriate.

(iii)
Applicable Principles of Section
734(b) Exchanges
. Notwithstanding any provisions to the
contrary in this Agreement, the foregoing treatment set out in Section 2.3(b)(ii) shall not be required to apply to payments hereunder to an Exchange TRA Party in respect of a Section 734(b) Exchange by such Exchange TRA Party. For the
avoidance of doubt, payments made under this Agreement relating to a Section 734(b) Exchange shall not be treated as resulting in a Basis Adjustment to the extent such payments are treated as Imputed Interest. The parties intend that
(A) an Exchange TRA Party that has made a Section 734(b) Exchange shall, with respect to the Basis Adjustment resulting from such Section 734(b) Exchange or any payments hereunder in respect of such Section 734(b) Exchange, be
entitled to Tax Benefit Payments attributable to such Basis Adjustments only to the extent such Basis Adjustments are allocable to the PubCo Group Members following such Section 734(b) Exchange (without taking into account any concurrent or
subsequent Exchanges) and (B) if, as a result of a subsequent Exchange, an increased portion of the Basis Adjustments resulting from such Section 734(b) Exchange or any payments hereunder in respect of such Section 734(b) Exchange
becomes allocable to the PubCo Group Members, then the Exchange TRA Party that makes such subsequent Exchange shall be entitled to a Tax Benefit Payment calculated in respect of such increased portion. For purposes of this Agreement, the increased
portion of such Basis Adjustments that becomes allocable to the PubCo Group Members as a result of a subsequent Exchange as described in clause (B) of the previous sentence shall be reported and treated as Exchange Basis for purposes of this
Agreement.



18



(iv)
Applicable Principles for Exchange Basis and Reorganization
Transferred Basis
. For the avoidance of doubt, the Realized Tax Benefit (or the Realized Tax Detriment) attributable to the Exchange Basis or Reorganization Transferred Basis is intended to represent the decrease (or increase) in the actual
liability for Taxes of the PubCo Group Members for such Taxable Year attributable to the Tax deductions allocable to the PubCo Group Members that result from the Tax basis of the Reference Assets measured at the time of the Reorganization or the
relevant Exchange, as applicable, in excess of Tax deductions allocable to the PubCo Group Members that result from the IPO Basis existing as of such time. Any Tax Benefit Payments attributable to the Exchange Basis or Reorganization Transferred
Basis are Attributable to, and are intended to be allocated and paid to, the relevant TRA Parties proportionately based on the Basis Sharing Percentage of each such TRA Party; provided, however, that any Tax Benefit Payments attributable to any
adjustment to Tax basis in relation to the PubCo Unit Contributions that results from any payment under this Agreement shall be Attributable to the Reorganization TRA Parties that contributed Units in the PubCo Unit Contributions.

(v)
Amounts Attributable to Blocker Shareholders and AS General Partner
. On or about the date of this Agreement, the
Blocker Shareholders and the AS General Partner contributed all of their rights under this Agreement to the AS New Aggregator (with the AS New Aggregator becoming a “TRA Party” and “Reorganization TRA Party”). By reason of
such contributions, any Tax Attribute that would otherwise be Attributable to the Blocker Shareholders or the AS General Partner shall be Attributable to the AS New Aggregator.

(vi)
Applicable Principles of Pillar Two
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent
that any Tax Attributes increase UTPR Taxes over the amount of UTPR Taxes that would be payable absent the Tax Attributes (as determined on a “with and without” basis in a manner consistent with this Agreement), the Realized Tax Benefit
or Realized Tax Detriment shall be decreased or increased, as applicable, to take into account such increase in UTPR Taxes. The TRA Parties agree that PubCo and OpCo may make reasonable assumptions and estimates consistent with the purpose of this
section to reduce administrative burdens on PubCo and OpCo when computing whether the Tax Attributes resulted in an increase in UTPR Taxes;
provided
,
however
, that PubCo shall disclose any such assumptions or estimates in the Tax
Benefit Schedule and such assumptions and estimates shall be subject to the procedures set forth in Section 2.4.

SECTION 2.4

Procedures, Amendments
.

(a)
Procedure
. Every time PubCo delivers to the TRA Party Representative an applicable
Schedule under this Agreement, including any Amended Schedule, PubCo shall also (x) deliver to the TRA Party Representative supporting schedules and work papers, as determined by PubCo or as reasonably requested by the TRA Party Representative,
providing reasonable detail regarding data and calculations that were relevant for purposes of preparing such Schedule and (y) allow the TRA Party Representative reasonable access at no cost to the appropriate representatives at PubCo, as
determined by PubCo or as reasonably



19



requested by the TRA Party Representative, in connection with a review of such Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, PubCo shall ensure that any Tax Benefit
Schedule that is delivered to the TRA Party Representative, along with any supporting schedules and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax Liability and the Hypothetical Tax Liability and
identifies any material assumptions or operating procedures or principles that were used for purposes of such calculations. An applicable Schedule or amendment thereto shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from
the date on which the TRA Party Representative is treated as having received the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under Section 7.1 unless the TRA Party Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days from such date
provides PubCo with written notice of a material objection to such Schedule (“
Objection Notice
”) made in good faith or (ii) provides a written waiver of such right of any Objection Notice within the period described in
clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule or amendment thereto becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by PubCo. If PubCo and the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in
the Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by PubCo of an Objection Notice, PubCo and the TRA Party Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures as described in Section 7.9 of this Agreement (the
“
Reconciliation Procedures
”).

(b)
Amended Schedule
. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year may be
amended from time to time by PubCo (i) in connection with a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct inaccuracies in the Schedule identified as a result of the receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable
Year after the date the Schedule was provided to the TRA Party Representative, (iii) to comply with an Expert’s determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or the Realized
Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a loss or other Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax Benefit or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year
attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi) to adjust an applicable TRA Party’s Attribute Schedule to take into account payments made pursuant to this Agreement (any such Schedule, an “
Amended
Schedule
”). PubCo shall provide an Amended Schedule to the TRA Party Representative when PubCo delivers the Attribute Schedule for the following Taxable Year.

ARTICLE III

TAX
BENEFIT PAYMENTS

SECTION 3.1
Payments
.

(a)
Payments
. Within five (5) Business Days after a Tax Benefit Schedule delivered to the TRA Party Representative becomes final
in accordance with Section 2.4(a) and Section 7.9, if applicable, PubCo shall pay each TRA Party for such Taxable Year the Tax Benefit Payment determined pursuant to Section 3.1(b) that is Attributable to such TRA Party. If PubCo is
current in respect of its payment obligations owed to each TRA Party under this Agreement, PubCo may, at any time on or after the due date (without extensions) of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of PubCo for a Taxable Year, make one or more
estimated payments to the TRA Parties in respect of any amounts anticipated to be owed with respect to



20



such Taxable Year to the TRA Parties pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) (an “
Advance Payment
”); provided that, if PubCo makes Advance Payments, it must make Advance
Payments to all TRA Parties eligible to receive payments under this Agreement with respect to a particular Taxable Year in proportion to their respective amounts of anticipated payments under this Agreement in respect of such Taxable Year. Any
Advance Payment made to the TRA Parties shall first be applied to any Interest Amount for such Taxable Year and then to the remaining amount of the Tax Benefit Payment to be made pursuant to this Section 3.1(a). Each such Tax Benefit Payment
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account previously designated by such TRA Party to PubCo or as otherwise agreed by PubCo and such TRA Party. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) no Tax Benefit Payment shall
be made in respect of estimated Tax payments, including, without limitation, U.S. federal estimated income Tax payments and (y) the payments provided for pursuant to the above sentence shall be computed separately for each TRA Party. No TRA
Party shall be required to make a payment or return a payment to PubCo in respect of any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment previously paid to such TRA Party (including any portion of any Early Termination Payment or, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Advance Payment);
provided
,
however
, that, if PubCo makes a payment to a TRA Party under this Agreement in an amount that exceeds the amount that should have been paid to such TRA Party (including after taking into account any
Determination that would have changed the Net Tax Benefit or any other calculation under this Agreement in any prior Taxable Year), then the amount of such excess shall offset and reduce,
dollar-for-dollar,
any future payments payable to such TRA Party under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to each Exchange by or with respect to an
Exchange TRA Party, if the Exchange TRA Party notifies PubCo in writing of a stated maximum selling price (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 15A.453-1(c)(2)),
then the amount of the
consideration received in connection with such Exchange and the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments to such Exchange TRA Party in respect of such Exchange (other than amounts accounted for as interest under the Code) shall not exceed such stated maximum
selling price.

(b) A “
Tax Benefit Payment
” in respect of a TRA Party for a Taxable Year means an amount, not
less than zero, equal to the Net Tax Benefit that is Attributable to such TRA Party and the Interest Amount with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, for Tax purposes, the Interest Amount shall not be treated as interest, but instead, shall
be treated as additional consideration in the applicable transaction, unless otherwise required by law. Subject to Section 3.3, the “
Net Tax Benefit
” for a Taxable Year shall be an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of 85% of the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of such Taxable Year, over the total amount of payments previously made under the first sentence of Section 3.1(a) (excluding payments attributable to Interest Amounts). The
“
Interest Amount
” shall equal the interest on the Net Tax Benefit calculated at the Agreed Rate from the due date (without extensions) for filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of PubCo with respect to Taxes for such
Taxable Year until the payment date under Section 3.1(a) (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any Advance Payments).

SECTION
3.2

No Duplicative Payments
. It is intended that the provisions of this Agreement will not
result in duplicative payment of any amount (including interest) required under this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in the appropriate manner to ensure such intentions are realized.



21



SECTION
3.3

Pro Rata Payments
. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the aggregate Realized Tax Benefit of the PubCo Group Members with respect to the Tax Attributes is limited in a particular Taxable Year because the PubCo Group Members do not have
sufficient taxable income, the Net Tax Benefit for that Taxable Year shall be allocated among all parties then-eligible to receive Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement in proportion to the amounts of Net Tax Benefit for that Taxable Year,
respectively, that would have been Attributable to each TRA Party if the PubCo Group Members had sufficient taxable income so that there were no such limitation; provided that, for purposes of determining the Net Tax Benefit that is Attributable to
any TRA Party and allocating among the TRA Parties the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement with respect to any Taxable Year, the operation of this Section 3.3 with respect to any prior Taxable Year shall be taken into account,
it being the intention of the parties to this Agreement for each TRA Party eligible for payments hereunder to receive, in the aggregate, Tax Benefit Payments in proportion to the aggregate Net Tax Benefits Attributable to such party had there been
sufficient taxable income to utilize all available Tax Attributes. For the avoidance of doubt, the determination of whether Tax Benefit Payments are not payable as a result of the application of Section 3.7 shall not be relevant in the
determination of whether a Net Tax Benefit is eligible to be allocated to the relevant TRA Party for purposes of this Section 3.3.

SECTION
3.4

Payment Ordering
. If for any reason PubCo does not fully satisfy its payment obligations
to make all Tax Benefit Payments due under this Agreement in respect of a particular Taxable Year, then PubCo and the TRA Parties agree that (i) Tax Benefit Payments for such Taxable Year that are made shall be allocated to all parties eligible
to receive Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement in such Taxable Year in proportion to the amounts of Tax Benefit Payments, respectively, that would have been made to each TRA Party if PubCo had sufficient cash available to make such Tax Benefit
Payments and (ii) no Tax Benefit Payments shall be made in respect of any Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit Payments to all TRA Parties in respect of all prior Taxable Years have been made in full;
provided
,
however
, that any
payments that were previously not made as a result of the application of Section 3.7 and have now become due and payable pursuant to Section 3.7 shall be made prior to any other Tax Benefit Payments.

SECTION
3.5

Limitation
. If the Net Tax Benefit for a Taxable Year is reduced as a result of any tax
detriment attributable to any TRA Party or any payment to a TRA Party under this Agreement in an amount that exceeds the amount that should have been paid to such TRA Party (including after taking into account any Determination that would have
changed the Net Tax Benefit or any other calculation under this Agreement in any prior Taxable Year), the Net Tax Benefit for such Taxable Year and any future Taxable Year shall be allocated among the TRA Parties in a manner such that, to the
maximum extent possible, each other TRA Party receives aggregate payments under Section 3.1(a) (taking into account Section 3.3) in the amount it would have received if there had been no such tax detriment attributable to or excess payment
to another TRA Party.

SECTION
3.6

Payments Attributable to Unvested Units
. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if any Unvested Unit is forfeited, no Tax Benefit Payment (or any other payment under this Agreement) that is attributable to such Unvested Unit and would otherwise become due and payable after the date of
such forfeiture shall be required to be made.



22



SECTION
3.7

Threshold Exchanges
.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Tax Benefit Payments with respect to IPO Basis shall be made to an Exchange TRA Party in respect of any Units held after the Reorganization until such Exchange TRA Party has exchanged Units in one
or more Exchanges equal to 5% of the Units (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Unvested Units) that such Exchange TRA Party held prior to the Reorganization (determined after giving effect to the Unit Distributions) (such Units, such
Exchange TRA Party’s “
Threshold Exchange Units
,” and an Exchange of Threshold Exchange Units, a “
Threshold Exchange
”). The amount retained by PubCo in respect of any Exchange TRA Party until
the occurrence of a Threshold Exchange (such Exchange TRA Party’s “
Retained Amount
”) shall include the Interest Amount in respect of any associated Net Tax Benefit, calculated through the due date for the Tax Benefit
Payment that would otherwise apply under Section 3.1(a), but shall not otherwise accrue interest. After the occurrence of a Threshold Exchange by an Exchange TRA Party, PubCo shall, on the first due date for Tax Benefit Payments under this
Agreement after such Threshold Exchange, pay the applicable Exchange TRA Party an amount equal to such Exchange TRA Party’s Retained Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) all Tax Benefit Payments with
respect to IPO Basis shall be required to be paid no later than the date of any payment required to be made to such TRA Party pursuant to Article IV of this Agreement, and (b) the restrictions in this Section 3.7 shall not apply with
respect to IPO Basis attributable to any Acquired Units directly or indirectly transferred in the Reorganization.

ARTICLE IV

TERMINATION

SECTION 4.1
Early Termination of Agreement; Breach of Agreement
.

(a) PubCo may (with approval of its Board) terminate this Agreement with respect to (i) all amounts payable to the TRA Parties and with
respect to all of the Units held by the TRA Parties at any time by paying to each TRA Party the Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party or (ii) the amount payable to any individual TRA Party having rights to less than 5% of the
aggregate IPO Basis Percentage by paying to any such individual TRA Party the Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party (any individual TRA Party that receives payments described in this clause (ii), an “
Individual Payment
Recipient
”);
provided
,
however
, that this Agreement shall only terminate upon the receipt of the Early Termination Payment by all TRA Parties, and
provided
,
further
, that PubCo may withdraw any notice to
execute its termination rights under this Section 4.1(a) prior to the time at which any Early Termination Payment has been paid. Upon payment of the Early Termination Payment in respect of each TRA Party (or in respect of any Individual Payment
Recipient) by PubCo, PubCo shall have no further payment obligations under this Agreement (or, in the case of an Early Termination Payment in respect of an Individual Payment Recipient, with respect to such Individual Payment Recipient under this
Agreement), other than for any (a) Tax Benefit Payments due and payable and that remain unpaid as of the Early Termination Notice and (b) Tax Benefit Payment due for the Taxable Year ending with or including the date



23



of the Early Termination Notice (except to the extent that the amount described in clause (b) is included in the Early Termination Payment). If an Exchange occurs after PubCo makes all of
the required Early Termination Payments under clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 4.1(a), as applicable, PubCo shall have no obligations under this Agreement with respect to such Exchange to (A) in the case of Early Termination
Payments under clause (i), any TRA Party, or (B) in the case of any Early Termination Payment under clause (ii), the applicable Individual Payment Recipient.

(b) In the event that (1) PubCo breaches any of its material obligations under this Agreement, whether as a result of failure to make
any payment when due, failure to honor any other material obligation required hereunder or by operation of law as a result of the rejection of this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, unless otherwise waived in
writing by the TRA Party Representative (any such breach to the extent not waived, a “
Material Breach
”) or (2)(A) PubCo commences any case, proceeding or other action (i) under any existing or future law of any
jurisdiction, domestic or foreign, relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of debtors, seeking to have an order for relief entered with respect to it, or seeking to adjudicate a bankruptcy or insolvency, or seeking
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
winding-up,
liquidation, dissolution, composition or other relief with respect to it or its debts or (ii) seeking an appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian,
conservator or other similar official for it or for all or any substantial part of its assets, or it makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or (B) there is commenced against PubCo any case, proceeding or other action of the
nature referred to in clause (A) above that remains undismissed or undischarged for a period of sixty (60) calendar days, all obligations hereunder shall be automatically accelerated and shall be immediately due and payable, and such
obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such breach and shall include, but not be limited to, (x) the Early Termination Payments calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been
delivered to the TRA Party Representative on the date of a breach, (y) any Tax Benefit Payment due and payable and that remains unpaid as of the date of a breach, and (z) any Tax Benefit Payment in respect of any TRA Party due for any
Taxable Year ending prior to, with or including the date of a breach;
provided
, that procedures similar to the procedures of Section 4.2 shall apply with respect to the determination of the amount payable by PubCo pursuant to this
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that PubCo breaches this Agreement and such breach is a Material Breach, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each TRA Party shall be entitled to elect to receive the amounts set
forth in clauses (x), (y) and (z) above or to seek specific performance of the terms hereof. The parties agree that the failure to make any payment due pursuant to this Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date such payment is due shall
be deemed to be a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement, and that it will not be considered to be a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to this
Agreement within sixty (60) days of the date such payment is due. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it shall not be a breach of a material obligation of this Agreement if PubCo fails to make any Tax Benefit Payment
when due to the extent that PubCo has insufficient funds to make such payment and is unable to obtain funds to make such payment after using commercially reasonable efforts to do so;
provided
, that the interest provisions of Section 5.2
shall apply to such late payment (unless PubCo does not have sufficient funds to make such payment as a result of limitations imposed by any Senior Obligations, in which case Section 5.2 shall apply, but the Default Rate shall be replaced by
the Agreed Rate). PubCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) obtain sufficient available funds for the purpose of making Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement and (2) avoid entering into any agreements after the date of
this Agreement that could be reasonably anticipated to materially delay the timing of the making of any Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement.



24



(c) In the event of a Change of Control, all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated and
such obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such Change of Control and utilizing the Valuation Assumptions by substituting in each case the terms “the closing date (or the date of
effectiveness or occurrence (as the context implies)) of a Change of Control” in each place where the phrase “Early Termination Date” appears. Such obligations shall include (1) the Early Termination Payments calculated as if
the Early Termination Date is the date of such Change of Control, (2) any Tax Benefit Payment due and payable and that remains unpaid as of the date of such Change of Control, and (3) any Tax Benefit Payment in respect of any TRA Party due
for any Taxable Year ending prior to, with or including the date of such Change of Control (except to the extent any amounts described in clause (2) or (3) are included in the Early Termination Payment). For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 4.2
and 4.3 shall apply to a Change of Control,
mutatis mutandis
.

SECTION
4.2
Early Termination Notice
. If
PubCo chooses to exercise its right of early termination under Section 4.1(a) above, PubCo shall deliver to the TRA Party Representative notice of such intention to exercise such right (“
Early Termination Notice
”) and
a schedule (the “
Early Termination Schedule
”) specifying PubCo’s intention to exercise such right under either clause (i) or (ii) thereof and showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the Early Termination
Payment(s) due for each relevant TRA Party. Each Early Termination Schedule shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which the TRA Party Representative is treated as having received such
Schedule or amendment thereto under Section 7.1 unless the TRA Party Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days after such date provides PubCo with notice of a material objection to such Schedule made in good faith
(“
Material Ob
j
ection Notice
”) or (ii) provides a written waiver of such right of a Material Objection Notice within the period described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule
becomes binding on the date the waiver is received by PubCo. If PubCo and the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by PubCo
of the Material Objection Notice, PubCo and the TRA Party Representative shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures in which case such Schedule becomes binding ten (10) calendar days after the conclusion of the Reconciliation Procedures.

SECTION
4.3

Payment upon Early Termination
.

(a) Within five (5) Business Days after an Early Termination Effective Date, PubCo shall pay to each relevant TRA Party an amount equal
to the Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party. Such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts designated by such TRA Party or as otherwise agreed by PubCo and such TRA Party
or, in the absence of such designation or agreement, by check mailed to the last mailing address provided by such TRA Party to PubCo.



25



(b) “
Early Termination Payment
” in respect of a TRA Party shall equal
the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of the applicable Early Termination Effective Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments in respect of such TRA Party that would be required to be paid by PubCo beginning from the Early
Termination Date and assuming that the Valuation Assumptions in respect of such TRA Party are applied and that each Tax Benefit Payment for the relevant Taxable Year would be due and payable on the due date (without extensions) under applicable law
as of the Early Termination Effective Date for filing of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of PubCo. For the avoidance of doubt, an entire Early Termination Payment shall be made to each applicable TRA Party regardless of whether such TRA Party
has exchanged all of its Units as of the Early Termination Date.

ARTICLE V

SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS

SECTION
5.1
Subordination
. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit
Payment required to be made by PubCo to the TRA Parties under this Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to any principal, interest or other amounts due and payable in respect of any obligations in respect of indebtedness
for borrowed money of PubCo and its Subsidiaries (“
Senior Obligations
”) and shall rank
pari passu
in right of payment with all current or future unsecured obligations of PubCo that are not Senior Obligations. To the
extent that any payment under this Agreement is not permitted to be made at the time payment is due as a result of this Section 5.1 and the terms of agreements governing Senior Obligations, such payment obligation nevertheless shall accrue for
the benefit of TRA Parties and PubCo shall make such payments at the first opportunity that such payments are permitted to be made in accordance with the terms of the Senior Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, to the extent that PubCo or any of its Affiliates enters into future Tax receivable or other similar agreements (“
Future TRAs
”), PubCo shall ensure that the terms of any such Future TRA provide that the Tax
Attributes subject to this Agreement are considered senior in priority to any Tax attributes subject to any such Future TRA for purposes of calculating the amount and timing of payments under any such Future TRA.

SECTION
5.2

Late Payments by PubCo
. Subject to the proviso in the next to last sentence of
Section 4.1(b), the amount of all or any portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made to the TRA Parties when due under the terms of this Agreement, whether as a result of Section 5.1 or otherwise, shall be
payable together with any interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate and commencing from the date on which such Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment was first due and payable to the date of actual payment.



26



ARTICLE VI

NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION

SECTION
6.1

Participation in PubCo
’
s and
OpCo
’
s Tax Matters
. PubCo shall promptly notify the TRA Party Representative of, and keep the TRA Party Representative reasonably informed with respect to, the portion of any audit, examination,
investigation, contest, or other administrative or judicial proceeding (a “
Tax Proceeding
”) of any PubCo Group Member, OpCo (or any entity with respect to which OpCo is a continuation under Section 708 of the Code) or
any of their direct or indirect Subsidiaries by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which is reasonably expected to materially affect any TRA Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement. The TRA Party Representative shall have the right
to be reasonably informed and to monitor at its own expense (but not to control) any portion of any Tax Proceeding of any PubCo Group Member, OpCo (or any entity with respect to which OpCo is a continuation under Section 708 of the Code) or any
of their direct or indirect Subsidiaries by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which is reasonably expected to materially affect either the TRA Party Representative’s or any TRA Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement. PubCo
shall (and shall cause the PubCo Group Members and OpCo to) (a) provide to the TRA Party Representative reasonable opportunity to provide information and other input to the PubCo Group Members, OpCo and their advisors concerning the conduct of
any such portion of such Tax Proceeding and (b) not settle or fail to contest (or cause or permit OpCo or any representative thereof to settle or fail to contest) any issue in any such portion of such Tax Proceeding without the prior written
consent of the TRA Party Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided
,
however
, that no PubCo Group Member shall be required to take any action in connection with such Tax
Proceeding that is inconsistent with any provision of this Agreement or the OpCo Agreement. If the TRA Party Representative fails to respond to any notice from the PubCo Group Members with respect to the settlement of any such issue within fifteen
(15) days of the TRA Party Representative’s receipt of the applicable notice, the TRA Party Representative shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed settlement or other disposition.

a manner consistent with that contemplated by this Agreement or specified by PubCo in any Schedule required to be provided by or on behalf of PubCo under this Agreement unless otherwise required by law. PubCo shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries,

faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent

SECTION
7.6

Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers
.

(a) No TRA Party may assign, sell, pledge, or otherwise alienate or transfer any of its interests in this Agreement, including the right to
receive Tax Benefit Payments under this Agreement, to any Person, except with the prior written consent of PubCo;
provided
,
however
, that such consent shall not be required: (i) in the case of a transfer by any TRA Party of such
transferor’s interests in this Agreement and rights to receive Tax Benefit Payments hereunder with respect to (x) any Units that have previously been Exchanged or (y) any Acquired Units or any Tax Attributes that are Attributable to
a Reorganization TRA Party, or (ii) if such assignment occurs in connection with or subsequent to an assignment to the same Person of Units in accordance with the OpCo Agreement and assigns only the rights under this Agreement related to the
assigned Units. If a TRA Party transfers Units in accordance with the terms of the OpCo Agreement but does not assign to the transferee of such Units its rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to such transferred Units,
(i) such TRA Party shall



29



remain a TRA Party under this Agreement for all purposes, including with respect to the receipt of Tax Benefit Payments to the extent payable hereunder (including any Tax Benefit Payments in
respect of the Exchanges of such transferred Units by such transferee), and (ii) the transferee of such Units shall not be a TRA Party with respect to such Units. In connection with any assignment or transfer permitted under this Agreement, the
transferee shall execute and deliver a joinder to this Agreement, substantially in form of
Exhibit A
hereto, agreeing to become a TRA Party for all purposes of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in such joinder. PubCo shall not
assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any Person (other than pursuant to a Mandatory Assignment) without the prior written consent of the TRA Party Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Any purported assignment or other transfer of this Agreement or any interest therein in violation of the foregoing in this
Section
7.6(a
) shall be null and void.

(b) No provision of this Agreement may be amended unless such amendment is approved in writing by each of PubCo (following approval of its
Board) and by the TRA Parties who would be entitled to receive at least
two-thirds
(2/3) of the total amount of the Early Termination Payments payable to all TRA Parties hereunder if PubCo had exercised its
right of early termination on the date of the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to this Agreement since the date of such most recent Exchange);

provided
, that no such amendment shall be effective if such amendment would have a material and disproportionate effect on the payments one or more TRA Parties would be entitled to receive under this Agreement unless such amendment is consented
to in writing by such TRA Parties disproportionately affected who would be entitled to receive at least a majority of the total amount of the Early Termination Payments payable to all TRA Parties disproportionately affected hereunder if PubCo had
exercised its right of early termination on the date of the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment (excluding, for purposes of this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party pursuant to this Agreement since the date of such most recent
Exchange). No provision of this Agreement may be waived unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(c) All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and legal representatives. PubCo shall, by written agreement, require and cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase, merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of PubCo expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that PubCo would be required to perform if no such
succession had taken place (a “
Mandatory Assignment
”).

action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in federal and state courts located in the State of Delaware, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of each such court (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the
action shall be heard and determined only in any such court, and agrees not to bring any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to
affect the right of any Party to serve process in any manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other Party in any other jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any action brought

Section
7.8
. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.


SECTION
7.9

Reconciliation
. In the event that PubCo and the TRA Party Representative are unable
to resolve a disagreement with respect to the calculations required to produce the schedules described in Sections 2.2, 2.3, and 4.2 (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any legal interpretation with respect to such provisions)
within the relevant period designated in this Agreement (“
Reconciliation Dispute
”), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally recognized expert in the particular area of disagreement,
acting as an expert and not as an arbitrator (the “
Expert
”), mutually acceptable to PubCo and the TRA Party Representative. The Expert shall be a nationally recognized accounting or law firm, and unless PubCo and the TRA
Party Representative agree otherwise, the Expert shall not have any material relationship with PubCo or the TRA Party Representative or other actual or potential conflict of interest. If PubCo and the TRA Party Representative are unable to agree on
an Expert within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt by the respondent(s) of written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, then the Expert shall be appointed by the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise (the
“
ICC
”) in accordance with the criteria set forth above in this
Section
7.9
. The Expert shall resolve any matter relating to any TRA Party’s Attribute Schedule or an amendment thereto or the
Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto within thirty (30) calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days or as soon thereafter as is
reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is the subject of a disagreement would be due (in
the absence of such disagreement) or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, the undisputed amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by PubCo, subject to
adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The costs and expenses relating to the engagement (and, if applicable, the selection by the ICC) of such Expert or amending any Tax Return shall be borne by PubCo except as provided in the next sentence.
PubCo and the TRA Party Representative shall bear their own costs and expenses of such proceeding, unless (i) the Expert adopts the TRA Party Representative’s position, in which case PubCo shall reimburse the TRA Party Representative for
any reasonable
out-of-pocket
costs and expenses in such proceeding, or (ii) the Expert adopts PubCo’s position, in which case the TRA Party Representative
shall reimburse PubCo for any reasonable
out-of-pocket
costs and expenses in such proceeding. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the
meaning of this Section 7.9 shall be decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 7.9 shall be binding on PubCo, the TRA Party
Representative and each of the TRA Parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.



31



SECTION
7.10

Withholding
. PubCo shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as PubCo is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law;
provided
, that PubCo shall have first notified the TRA Party Representative of its intent to deduct or withhold, and PubCo and the TRA Party Representative shall have discussed in good faith whether such Taxes can be mitigated to the
extent permitted under applicable law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by PubCo, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such withholding was made. To the extent that any payment pursuant to this Agreement is not reduced by such deductions or withholdings, such recipient shall indemnify the applicable withholding agent for any amounts imposed by any
Taxing Authority together with any costs and expenses related thereto. Each TRA Party shall promptly provide PubCo, OpCo or any other applicable withholding agent with any applicable Tax forms and certifications (including IRS Form
W-9
or the applicable version of IRS Form
W-8)
reasonably requested, in connection with determining whether any such deductions and withholdings are required under the Code or
any provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax law.

SECTION 7.11
Admission of PubCo into a Consolidated Group; Transfers of
Corporate Assets
.

(a) If PubCo is or becomes a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of corporations
that files a consolidated income Tax Return pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code or any corresponding provisions of state or local law, then: (i) the provisions of this Agreement shall be applied with respect to the group as a whole;
and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments, Early Termination Payments and other applicable items hereunder shall be computed with reference to the consolidated taxable income of the group as a whole. PubCo agrees that, except as otherwise required by
applicable law or agreed in writing by the TRA Party Representative, PubCo, the Blockers, and GP NewCo shall file a consolidated income Tax Return pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code.

(b) If any PubCo Group Member (or, without duplication, any member of a group described in Section 7.11(a) or entity that is controlled
by any such member) or Opco (or any entity in which it directly or indirectly owns an interest) transfers (or is treated as transferring for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) any Reference Asset to a transferee that is treated as a corporation for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes (other than a member of a U.S. federal consolidated group described in Section 7.11(a)), such entity shall be treated as having disposed of such Reference Asset in a fully taxable transaction on the date of such
transfer. The consideration deemed to be received by such entity in a transaction contemplated in the prior sentence shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed transferred asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is
subject, in the case of a transfer of an encumbered asset, or (ii) the amount of debt allocated to such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest. If any PubCo Group Member (or, without duplication, any member of a group
described in Section 7.11(a) or entity that is controlled by any such member) transfers (or is treated as



32



transferring for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) any Unit (other than to a member of a U.S. federal consolidated group described in Section 7.11(a)), then OpCo shall be treated as having
disposed of the portion of any Reference Asset that is indirectly transferred by such PubCo Group Member (or other applicable Person) (
i.e.
, taking into account the Units transferred) in a fully taxable transaction in which all income, gain
or loss is allocated to the PubCo Group Member (or the other applicable Person).

(c) If any member of a group described in
Section 7.11(a) (including any PubCo Group Member) that owns any Unit or Reference Asset (or is treated as owning any Unit or Reference Asset for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) deconsolidates from the group (or PubCo deconsolidates from the
group), then PubCo shall cause such member (or the parent of the group in a case where PubCo deconsolidates from the group) to assume the primary obligation to make payments hereunder with respect to the applicable Tax Attributes associated with any
Reference Asset that such member or such parent directly or indirectly owns and any other Tax Attributes that such member or such parent is entitled to utilize, in each case, in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement as the member or
parent (or, in each case, one of its Affiliates) actually realizes Tax benefits. In the event of any assumption described in the foregoing sentence, PubCo shall remain secondarily liable to make payments hereunder in respect of such Tax Attributes
and shall remain responsible for all obligations hereunder with respect to any Tax Attributes that PubCo (or any member of a group described in Section 7.11(a) or entity that is controlled by any such member) remains entitled to utilize
(including with respect to any Reference Assets directly or indirectly retained by PubCo). For the avoidance of doubt, the intent of this Section 7.11(c) is to cause the Person that is entitled to utilize any applicable Tax Attributes to be
obligated to make payments under this Agreement with respect to the benefits from such Tax Attributes.

SECTION 7.12

Confidentiality
.

(a) Each TRA Party and the TRA Party Representative, and each of their assignees, acknowledge and agree that
the Confidential Information (as defined herein) is confidential and

such Person shall keep and retain in the strictest confidence and not disclose, use, divulge, publish or otherwise reveal,
directly or indirectly through another Person, to any Person, any
non-public
information acquired pursuant to this Agreement, of PubCo and its Affiliates and successors, concerning OpCo and its Affiliates and
successors or the members of OpCo (such information, “
Confidential Information
”). Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is rightfully in the possession of the TRA Party or the TRA Party
Representative at the time of disclosure by or on behalf of PubCo, (ii) has been made publicly available by PubCo or any of its Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a result of an act of the TRA Party or the TRA Party Representative
in violation of this Agreement) or is generally known to the business community, (iii) is disclosed to the TRA Party or TRA Party Representative or their respective representatives by a third party not, to the knowledge of such TRA Party or the
TRA Party Representative, in violation of any obligation of confidentiality owed to PubCo or its Affiliates with respect to such information or (iv) is independently developed by such TRA Party or the TRA Party Representative or their
respective representatives without use of or reference to the Confidential Information. Each TRA Party and the TRA Party Representative may disclose Confidential Information (A) to the extent necessary for the TRA Party or its direct or
indirect owners to prepare and file its Tax Returns, to respond



33



to any inquiries regarding the same from any Taxing Authority or to prosecute or defend any action, proceeding or audit by any Taxing Authority with respect to such returns, (B) to its
Affiliates and its and their respective employees, directors, counsel and advisors on a confidential basis; provided that, such TRA Party or the TRA Party Representative will remain liable with respect to any breach of this Section 7.12 by any
of its respective Affiliates and its and their respective employees, directors, counsel and advisors, (C) as may be required in the course of performing a TRA Party’s or the TRA Party Representative’s obligations, or monitoring or
enforcing such party’s rights, under this Agreement or in performing duties as necessary for PubCo or its Affiliates, (D) as part of a TRA Party’s or the TRA Party Representative’s normal reporting, rating or review procedure
(including normal credit rating and pricing process), or in connection with a TRA Party’s or the TRA Party Representative’s or their respective Affiliates’ normal fund raising, financing, marketing, informational or reporting
activities, or to a TRA Party’s or the TRA Party Representative’s (or any of their respective Affiliates’) or their respective direct or indirect owners’ or Affiliates’, auditors, accountants, employees, attorneys or
other agents, (E) to any bona fide prospective assignee of a TRA Party’s rights under this Agreement, or prospective merger or other business combination partner of a TRA Party, provided that (i) such assignee or merger partner will
be informed by such TRA Party of the confidential nature of such information and shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Section 7.12 and (ii) each such TRA Party will remain liable for breaches of this
Section 7.12 by any such Person (as if such Persons were party to this Agreement for purposes of Section 7.12), (F) as is required to be disclosed by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, administrative body or governmental body, or
by subpoena, summons or legal process, or by law, rule or regulation; provided, that such TRA Party or the TRA Party Representative (I) shall give PubCo notice thereof as promptly as practicable (to the extent legally permitted), (II) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist PubCo in resisting or otherwise responding to such legal process at PubCo’s sole cost and expense and (III) shall limit such disclosures of Confidential Information to those actually required by
such a lawful and valid legal process (and the applicable TRA Party or the TRA Party Representative, as the case may be, shall be entitled to rely on the advice of its counsel for determining what is actually required), (G) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation against or involving PubCo and such TRA Party or the TRA Party Representative or (H) pursuant to the last sentence of Section 6.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the TRA Party
Representative, each TRA Party and each of its assignees (and each employee, representative or other agent of the TRA Party Representative, the TRA Party or its assignees, as applicable) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure of any PubCo Group Member, OpCo and their Affiliates, and any of their transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other Tax analyses) that are provided to the TRA Party Representative
or the TRA Party relating to such Tax treatment and Tax structure.

(b) If a TRA Party or the TRA Party Representative or an assignee
commits a breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 7.12, PubCo shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of this Section 7.12 specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by
any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to secure or post any bond or other security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to PubCo or any of its Subsidiaries or the
TRA Parties and the accounts and funds managed by PubCo and that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available
at law or in equity.



34



SECTION
7.13

Change in Law
. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if, in connection with an actual or proposed change in law, a TRA Party reasonably believes that the existence of this Agreement could cause income (other than income arising from receipt of a payment under this
Agreement) recognized by the TRA Party upon any Exchange by such TRA Party to be treated as ordinary income (other than by reason of the application of Section 751(a) of the Code to such Exchange) rather than capital gain (or otherwise be taxed
at ordinary income rates) for U.S. federal income Tax purposes or would have other material adverse Tax consequences to such TRA Party, then at the election of such TRA Party and to the extent specified by such TRA Party, this Agreement
(i) shall cease to have further effect with respect to such TRA Party, (ii) shall not apply to an Exchange by such TRA Party occurring after a date specified by such TRA Party, or (iii) shall otherwise be amended in a manner
determined by such TRA Party and PubCo as it relates to such TRA Party,
provided
, that such amendment shall not result in an increase in payments under this Agreement at any time as compared to the amounts and times of payments that would
have been due in the absence of such amendment.

SECTION
7.14

TRA Party Representative
. By
executing this Agreement, each of the TRA Parties shall be deemed to have irrevocably constituted the TRA Party Representative as his, her or its agent and attorney in fact with full power of substitution to act from and after the date hereof and to
do any and all things and execute any and all documents on behalf of such TRA Parties which may be necessary, convenient or appropriate to facilitate any matters under this Agreement, including but not limited to: (a) execution of the documents
and certificates required pursuant to this Agreement; (b) except to the extent specifically provided in this Agreement, receipt and forwarding of notices and communications pursuant to this Agreement; (c) administration of the provisions
of this Agreement; (d) any and all consents, waivers, amendments or modifications deemed by the TRA Party Representative to be necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and the execution or delivery of any documents that may be necessary or
appropriate in connection therewith; (e) amending this Agreement or any of the instruments to be delivered to PubCo pursuant to this Agreement; (f) taking actions the TRA Party Representative is expressly authorized to take pursuant to the
other provisions of this Agreement; and (g) negotiating and compromising, on behalf of such TRA Parties, any dispute that may arise under, and exercising or refraining from exercising any remedies available under, this Agreement or any other
agreement contemplated hereby and executing, on behalf of such TRA Parties, any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect to such dispute or remedy. In connection therewith, the TRA Party Representative shall be entitled to engage
attorneys, accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of such TRA Parties in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby and pay any fees related thereto on behalf of such TRA Parties. The TRA Party Representative may
be replaced at any time by approval of
two-thirds
of the TRA Parties (which
two-thirds
shall be determined based on the percentages of the TRA Parties’ IPO Basis
Percentage), with such replacement being effective seven (7) days after written notice of such vote is delivered to PubCo; provided that, the aforementioned
two-thirds
approval threshold shall be reduced
to
one-half
of the TRA Parties (which
one-half
shall be determined based on the percentage of the TRA Parties’ IPO Basis Percentage) in the event that the TRA
Party Representative has resigned, ceased to legally exist, or died.



35



All reasonable, documented

out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by the TRA Party Representative in its capacity as such shall be promptly reimbursed by PubCo upon invoice and reasonable
support therefor by the TRA Party Representative to PubCo. To the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the TRA Party Representative, any of its Affiliates, or any of the TRA Party Representative’s or Affiliate’s directors, officers,
employees or other agents (each a “
Covered Person
”) shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or otherwise to any TRA Party, OpCo or any PubCo Group Member for damages arising from any action taken or omitted
to be taken by the TRA Party Representative or any other Covered Person with respect to OpCo or any PubCo Group Member in connection with this Agreement, except in the case of any action or omission which constitutes, with respect to such Covered
Person, willful misconduct or fraud. Each of the Covered Persons may consult with legal counsel, accountants, and other experts selected by it, and any act or omission suffered or taken by it on behalf of the TRA Parties or in furtherance of the
interests of the TRA Parties in good faith in reliance upon and in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants, or other experts shall create a rebuttable presumption of the good faith and due care of such Covered Person with respect to
such act or omission;
provided
, that such counsel, accountants, or other experts were selected with reasonable care. Each of the Covered Persons may rely in good faith upon, and shall have no liability to OpCo, any PubCo Group Member or the
TRA Parties for acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The PubCo Group Members may rely in good faith upon, and shall have no liability to OpCo or the TRA Parties for acting or refraining from acting in reliance upon, any action, inaction,
decision, resolution, certificate, statement, correspondence, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, and consent by the TRA Party Representative.

SECTION 7.15
